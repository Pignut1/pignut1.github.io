<a name="folklore"><h2>Folklore of cabbages</h2></b>
Cabbages and other fleshy leaved plants are said to be sacred to the moon, by such 
authorities as Culpeper (see below). 
If the stump of a cabbage is left in the ground after harvest
 small cabbages will grow from it. Brussel sprouts grow in a neat clockwise helix, 
apparently following the path of the sun and moon, like 
<a href="Moonshine.html">vines</a>. Culpeper (see below) connected cabbages 
with vines, 
saying that the two will not grow in the same garden, and that cabbages could cure 
drunkenness
<br><br> Some gardeners 
consider it important to cut a neat cross in the stump of the cabbage, to 
encourage
regrowth. I tested this in my garden, and found that cabbages are more 
likely to regrow 
if the stalk is not mutilated.<a href="Bibliography.html#cabbage">[1]</a>
Cabbages belong to the cruciferae family, so called because their 
flowers have four petals arranged as a cross. A cross with arms of equal length 
is often said to be a symbol of the sun. For more on gardening folklore

                      <h2>CABBAGES AND COLEWORTS</h2>
<h3>[from Culpeper's complete herbal]</h3>

    <p>I SHALL spare labour in writing a description of these, since almost everyone that can but write at
all, may describe them from his own knowledge, they being generally so well known, that
descriptions are altogether needless. 

    <p>Place : They are generally planted in gardens. 

    <p>Time : Their flower time is towards the middle or end of July, and the seed is ripe in August. 

    <p>Government and virtues :<br> The Cabbages or Coleworts boiled 
gently in broth, and eaten, do
open the body, but the second decoction doth bind the body. The juice 
thereof drank in wine, helps
those that are bitten by an adder, and the decoction of the flowers brings 
down women's courses.
Being taken with honey, it recovers hoarseness, or loss of the voice. The 
often eating of them well
boiled, helps those that are entering into a consumption. The pulp of the 
middle ribs of Coleworts
boiled in almond milk, and made up into an electuary with honey, being 
taken often, is very
profitable for those that are puffy and short winded. Being boiled twice, 
an old cock boiled in the
broth and drank, it helps the pains and the obstructions of the liver and 
spleen, and the stone in the
kidneys. The juice boiled with honey, and dropped into the corner of the 
eyes, clears the sight, by
consuming any film or clouds beginning to dim it; it also consumes the 
cankers growing therein. They
are much commended, being eaten before meat to keep one from surfeiting, 
as also from being
drunk with too much wine, or quickly to make a man sober again that was 
drunk before. For (as
they say) there is such an antipathy or enmity between the Vine and the 
Coleworts, that the one will
die where the other grows. The decoction of Coleworts takes away the pain 
and ache, and allays
the swelling of sores and gouty legs and knees, wherein many gross and 
watery humours are fallen,
the place being bathed therewith warm. It helps also old and filthy sores, 
being bathed therewith, and
heals all small scabs, pushes, and wheals, that break out in the skin. The
 ashes of Colewort stalks
mixed with old hog's-grease, are very effectual to anoint the sides of 
those that have had long pains
therein, or any other place pained with melancholy and windy humours. This 
was surely Chrysippus's
God, and therefore he wrote a whole volume on them and their virtues, and 
that none of the least
neither, for he would be no small fool. He appropriates them to every part 
of the body, and to every
disease in every part; and honest old Cato (they say) used no other physic.
 I know not what metal
their bodies were made of; this I am sure, Cabbages are extremely windy, 
whether you take them as
meat or as medicine: yea, as windy meat as can be eaten, unless you eat 
bag-pipes or bellows, and
they are but seldom eaten in our days; and Colewort flowers are something 
more tolerable, and the
wholesomer food of the two. The Moon challenges the dominion of this herb.
