1999 07:57:32 -0400 <BR><BR>I am looking for a Moon Dial. By this, I am not 
talking about the usual kind which look/act like a sundial.<BR><BR>I am talking 
about the old Moon Dials. The illegal ones. Which align moonbeams through their 
aperatures.<BR>Their construction was outlawed in the last century. <BR><BR>Any 
ideas?<BR><BR><I>From: Ian Sanders [SMTP:ab456@ab.sac.ac.uk] Sent: Friday, 
August 06, 1999 9:54 AM To: Young, Kevin Subject: Re: <BR><BR>I am somewhat 
confused, but fascinated. There are many types of sun and <A 
href="Make_your_own_moondial.html">moondial</A> 
which do not resemble the ones normally seen in gardens. <BR><BR>The only types 
which I can think of which could fit your description would be the reflected 
ceiling dial, in which sun or moon light is reflected onto the ceiling of a 
room, off a mirror on a windowsill; or the perforated ring dial, a portable type 
of sun or moondial, consisting of a broad circular band with a hole in one side, 
through which sunlight or moonbeams could be projected onto a scale on the 
inside of the ring.<BR><BR>I was unaware that any moondials were made illegal in 
the last century. According to <A 
href="The_White_Goddess.html">Robert 
Graves</A>, the industrial revolution and the age of reason were (metaphorically 
speaking) inspired by the sun god Apollo, who controls science and technology, 
and led to a rejection of the Moon Goddess who controls art, poetry and magic. 
It does not surprise me, therefore that moondials would be outlawed at this 
time. Perhaps the next century will see conflicts as environmentalists (inspired 
by the Goddess) are forced to choose between solar energy and lunar energy (such 
as tidal power or maybe even something more esoteric).<BR><BR>Why were the 
moondials banned? Had the <A 
href="Erasmus.html">Birmingham Lunar 
Society</A>, the masonic think tank of the Industrial revolution whose symbol 
was a single solar or lunar <A 
href="wadjet.html">eye</A>, been overthrown in 
a coup d'etat by a rival group more dedicated to the worship of 
Apollo?<BR><BR>The transition from a lunar to a solar calendar was not an easy 
one, and almost certainly led to religious conflict. Today, Christians use a 
calendar with 12 "months" which bear little resemblance to the phases of the 
moon, whereas moslems still attach more importance to the lunar calendar and 
place the crescent on their flags. Moondials could easily be considered 
heretical.<BR><BR>I'm digressing again, and the forthcoming <A 
href="eclips.html">eclipse</A> is affecting my 
brain. Please tell me more, I think this could warrant a page on my site 
(properly credited of course).<BR><BR>Ian<BR><BR></I>From: "Young, Kevin"

<BR><BR>Possibly. Do you have any source references for any of this? I am 
reminded of the massive orbitting mirror which the Russians were planning to put 
into orbit a year or so ago, supposedly so as to reflect sunlight onto the earth 
during the long Siberian nights. Could it instead have been intended to reflect 
moonlight to hex any American "Star Wars" defense 
system?<BR><BR>Ian<BR><BR></I>&gt; From: "Young, Kevin"

Subject: RE: &gt; Date: Fri, 6 Aug 1999 09:24:47 -0400<BR><BR>I saw the Moon 
Dial on a PBS special years ago.<BR><BR>About the same height as a regular 
sundial, but more solid underneath, with various aperatures in the rock for the 
moonlight to go through. The head tilted on it for you to direct the reflected 
rays.<BR><BR><I>Can anyone shed any light on any of this? Has anyone seen the 
program Kevin refers to? Do you own or sell this type of illegal hexing 
moondial? Please leave a message in the <A href="index.html">guestbook</A> and let me 
know. </I>
