<H1>Lunar Rainbows</H1><BR><BR>Two letters to the New Scientist Last Word column 
(27th January 2001)asked about rainbows caused by moonlight. One observer saw 
:<I>...."the full moon ... producing an inverse rainbow </I>[having the red band 
on the inside and the blue on the outside]<I> in the 12 o'clock position 
directly above the moon.</I> as well as <I>....very bright spots of light in the 
3 and 9 o'clock positions on either side of the moon that also showed patches of 
rainbow.</I> <BR><BR>One respondent stated that the bright spots of light were 
<I>"mock moons or moon dogs"</I> and said that descriptions of this phenomena 
could be found in <I>The Nature of Light and Colour in the Outdoors</I> by 
Marcel Minnaert. All respondents attributed the phenomena to ice crystals in the 
atmosphere.<BR><BR>This phenomena would seem to be a variety of lunar 
halo.<BR><BR>The second observer described a complete rainbow, much like a solar 
rainbow, in that the moon was behind the observer and the arc seen in front of 
the observer. It was described as:<I> ....much dimmer than a normal rainbow and 
looked as though it had been washed through in sepia."</I> The time was early 
morning and the weather wet<BR><BR>Apparently the full moon is normally bright 
enough to produce rainbows, but these can only be seen under certain 
conditions:<BR>It must be within a day or two of the full moon, the moon must be 
low in the sky (&lt;42 degrees). The sky must be dark and the weather showery. 
Moon rainbows tend to be less colourful than solar rainbows for two main 
reasons: <BR>Our eyes don't see colour well in poor light, and also because 
moonlight is less colourful than sunlight and contains a lot of brown (?!), 
according to Albert Zjilstra of the Department of Physics, University of 
Manchester Institute of Science and Technology<A
