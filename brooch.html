This brooch was made by designer and engraver, Malcolm Appleby in 1997.
The title of the piece implies that it was inspired by "The Old Man of Hoy", a 
huge natural stack of rock off the coast of Orkney, Scotland. I can't help but notice the 
similarity to the Utchat, and the fact that it features a moonstone is 
interesting too. Unfortunately I missed a recent exhibition of his work, 
and the chance to meet him in person, so I might never know where he got his idea from.
