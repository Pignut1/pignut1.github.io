<p><i>"Once upon a time there was a king who had a daughter, and she was such a dreadful
story-teller that the like of her was not to be found far or near. So the king 
gave out, that if any one could tell such a string of lies as would get her to 
say, "That's a story," he should have her to wife, and half the kingdom besides.
Well , many came, as you may fancy, to try their luck, for every one would have 
been very glad to have the Princess, to say nothing of the kingdom; but they all
 cut a sorry figure, for the Princess was so given to story-telling, that all 
their lies went in at one ear and out of the other. Among the rest came three
 brothers to try their luck, and the two elder went first, but they fared no 
better than those who had gone before them. Last of all the third, Boots, set off
and found the Princess in the farmyard.<br>
  "Good morning," he said, "and thank you for nothing."<br>
"Good morning,"said she,"and the same to you."<br>
Then she went on-<br>
"You haven't such a big ox, after all, as ours yonder; for when two men sit,
 one on each horn, they can't touch each other with a twenty-foot rule."<br>
"Stuff!" said Boots; is that all? why, we have an ox who is so big, that 
when two men sit, one on each horn, and each blows his great mountain-trumpet,
 they can't hear one another."<br>
"I daresay!" said the princess; "but you haven't so much milk as we, I'll be bound
; for we milk our kine into great pails, and carry them indoors, and empty them 
into great tubs, and so we make great, great cheeses."<br>
"Oh you do, do you?" said Boots. "Well, we milk ours into great tubs, and then 
we put them in carts and drive them indoors, and then we turn them out into great
 brewing vats, and so we make cheeses as big as a great house. We had, too, a dun
 mare to tread the cheese well together when it was making
;but once she tumbled down into the cheese, and we lost her; and after we had 
eaten
 at this cheese seven years, we came upon a great dun mare, alive and kicking.
Well, once after that I was going to drive this mare to the mill, and her
 backbone snapped in two; but I wasn't put out, not I, for I took a spruce sapling,
and put it into her for a backbone, and she had no other backbone all the while 
we had her. But the sapling grew into such a tall tree, that I climbed right up 
to heaven by it, and when I got there, I saw an angel sitting and spinning the
 foam of the sea into pigs bristle ropes; but just then, the spruce-fir broke 
short off, and I couldn't get down again; so the kind angel let me down by one
 of the ropes, and down I slipped straight into a fox's hole, and who should sit
there but my mother and your father cobbling shoes; and just as I stepped in, my mother
gave your father such a box on the ear, that it made his whiskers curl."
<br>"That's a story! said the Princess; "my father never did any such thing in all his born days!"<br>
So Boots got the Princess to wife, and half the kingdom besides.</i>

I don't want to read too much into this story. 
Suffice it to say that this story
 has been retold, adapted and bowdlerised for children, 
but still contains some elements
 of earlier myths. It is similar to the Irish story of 
<a href="liar.html">The Liar</a>, as well as <a href="jack.html">Jack</a> 
and the beanstalk. Boots' story is not just surrealism: The horses backbone and 
the tree trunk are both symbols of the axis mundi, around which the heavens were believed 
to rotate, and which Shamen claimed to climb during altered states of 
consciousness. <br>
In some Siberian traditions, the Shamen rides a <a href="gisbourne.html#hobby">
"hobby horse"</a> consisting of a stick with a horses head attached, to symbolise the journey to the world tree, before entering his trance<a href="Bibliography.html#Stairway">[12]</a>.<br>
<a href="yggdra.html">Yggdrasil</a> was the world tree of the vikings, but 
the word can also be translated as "The horse of Ygg" Ygg was apparently another name for Odin.<br>
The mill is also a symbol for the rotating heavens. 
An ancient Greek term for the sky meant "corn mill". 
Once again, I am reminded of the story of <a href="Set.html#Samson">Samson</a><br><br>
There is an episode in the Kalevala (a collection of Finnish myths told in verse), 
in which Vainamoinen and Ilmarinen  go to seek the world tree:<br><br><i>
"When they reached the spot they sought for,<br>
On the edge of Osmo's cornfield,<br>
Then the smith his steps arrested,<br>
In amazement at the spruce tree,<br>
With the great Bear in it's branches,<br>
And the moon upon it's summit.<br><br>

Then the aged Vainamoinen,<br>
Spoke the very words which follow:<br>
"Now thou smith, my dearest brother,<br>
Climb and fetch the moon above us.<br>
Bring thou, too, the Great Bear shining<br>
On the spruce-tree's golden summit!""<br><br></i>

Curiously the tree is described as reaching up to both the Great Bear and to the moon. If it's summit is at the 
great bear, then the tree is probably meant to represent the axis mundi, as the great bear is close to the pole star, 
and roughly overhead in Finland (the word "arctic" derives from the Greek "arctos" or bear; meaning the area underneath
 the Great and Little bears). The moon would never be overhead as far north as Finland, and it is hard to see how the 
tree could have the moon at its summit, unless it was leaning quite dramatically. In any case, the Great Bear and the moon 
could not both be at the summit (at least not at the same time, maybe the tree was leaning about 30-40 degrees off vertical,
 pointing at the moon, when Vainamoinen and Ilmarinen first arrived, but they stood there astonished for several hours 
before Vainamoinen spoke, by which time the earth's rotation meant that the tree was now pointing roughly at the Great Bear).
 More likely two versions of the story have been confused by a 
poet with a poor understanding of astronomy.<br>
