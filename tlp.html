<b>Introduction</b><br>
"Transient Lunar Phenomena" (TLP) is a term used to describe anything which is 
seen on the moon which is not supposed
to be there, and which contradicts the view that the surface of the moon 
is dead and unchanging. TLP includes strange lights which appear and then 
subsequently vanish, areas of mist (sometimes coloured) and physical features 
which appear to come and go. The subject 
remains controversial, with TLP being dismissed as the result of misperception,
 or misidentification of craters
 by amateurs. TLP have however been observed by distinguished astronomers, 
and even Apollo astronauts. The subject is still largely ignored by 
astronomers <a href="Bibliography2.html#tlp">[2]</a>
but I feel that the subject 
has become marginally more respectable ever since Patrick Moore saw a TLP and took
an interest in the subject. Moore (who claims to have coined the term "TLP.")
restricts the term to red mists, which he explains (tentatively) as gases rising
 from below the lunar surface, possibly as a result of 
"moonquakes"<a href="Bibliography2.html#tlp">[3]</a>.<br><br>
More recently, the subject seems to have been linked to claims of massive ruined
cities on the moon, deduced from blurred photographs. As this latter subject is 
(in the words of Charles Fort) most definately "damned", I would prefer to keep 
the two subjects distinct, in the hope that astronomers will take TLP seriously.
I confess that I know very little about either of these subjects, and so I have 
included several links (bottom of page).<a href="#top">[top]</a><br><br>
<a name="history">
<b>A history of TLP</b><br> 
 In 1843, Julius Schmidt, the director of the Athens observatory observed that
 the crater Linne, in the <a href="Moon_diagram.html">Mare Serenitatis</a>
 (named after the pioneering taxonomist, Linnaeus) was
 several miles in diameter and entirely filled 
with shadow, when close to the terminator (the border between the 
illuminated and shadowed regions of the face of the moon). 
In 1866 he observed a white patch on the floor of the crater, 
in which later observers found a much smaller crater pit. 
Schmidt believed that this was due to volcanic activity. 
Moore <a href="Bibliography2.html#tlp">[4]</a> states that 
this is the earliest documented case of it's kind, and that for years prior to 
this, 
astronomers were not interested in the moon, but according to the NASA archives 
(link below) he is wrong.<br><p>
In his book, "New Lands, Charles Fort recorded many accounts of TLP, as part of
 a long polemic against astronomers. In particular, lights (sometimes flashing) 
in 
Aristarchus, Proclus, Bessel, Kepler, Carlini, Marius, 
<a href="Moon_diagram.html">Plato</a> and the 
<a href="Moon_diagram.html">Mare 
Crisium</a> ,  
black spots in Plinius, Littrow and 
<a href="Moon_diagram.html">Copernicus</a>, 
"two straight lines of 
light, between 
them a dark band that 
was covered with luminous points" in the western crater of Messier, 
a fine line
 of light "like a luminous cable" drawn across the crater Eudoxus, 
a similar 
sighting in Aristarchus, A "black wall" in Aristillus, 
 
a shining triangle in <a href="Moon_diagram.html">Plato</a>, changes in 
the appearance of Linne, a new object in Hyginus
 (named Hyginus N, before its subsequent disappearance), reddish mist in
 Hercules, <a href="Moon_diagram.html">Plato</a> and Cassini, 
shafts of light projecting from the moon and a
 frequently sighted bright spot to the west of Picard. Picard 
seems to feature
 in the more 
recent claims of artifacts on the moon.<br><br>
Fort observes that a great many of the TLP reports which he had heard 
about, took place in the north west quadrat of the moon (the top right of
 the moon as seen from the northern hemisphere).<br><br>
Recently astronomers have observed meteorites made entirely of ice 
entering the earths atmosphere (vindicating another of Fort's theories)
<a href="Bibliography2.html#tlp">[12]</a>
A recent letter in the <i>New Scientist</i> suggested that the "coloured 
vapours"
 seen on the surface of the moon could be caused by ice meteorites coliding with
 the surface of the moon and vapourising giving rise to a rainbow effect
<a href="Bibliography2.html#tlp">[13]</a>.
More recently, other astronomers have disputed the evidence for ice meteorites, 
describing it as "instrumental artifact" <a href="Bibliography2.html#tlp">[14]</a>. 
In true fortean fashion, this subject is not quite ready to be shoe-horned into 
current definitions of "reality".<br><br>

The following is taken from Coleridge's 
<i>"Rhyme of the ancient mariner"</a></i>,
around the time that the mariner meets <a href= "The_White_Goddess.html"> The White Goddess </a>

<p>"From the sails the dew did drip-<br>
Till clomb above the eastern bar<br>

This verse was apparently inspired by William Herschel's 
discovery of "three volcanoes in the

<b>Civilisation on the moon?</b><br>
Fort also records claims of cities upon
 the moon:<br><p> <i> "However, it may be that the general style of architecture upon 
the moon is Byzantine, very likely, or not so likely domed with glass, giving
 the dome-effect that has so often been commented upon."</i><br><p>
During the mid 1830's, the New York Sun reported that Sir John Herschel 
(the son of Sir William Herschel, see link below)
 had built the most 
powerful telescope known, using "hydro-oxygen reflectors", in his lab in Cape Town.
 The telescope was even capable of viewing objects on 
the moon, as small as 18 inches in diameter. The reports, were 
written by Dr Andrew Grant, Herschel's assistant, who said that forests, 
flocks of red and white birds, herds 
of "diminutive bison" had all been observed on the moon, along with 
strange beavers which lacked tails and walked on their
 hind legs. There were even people with bat like wings, who had built
 villages and pyramids. Observations ceased when a fire destroyed 
the observatory</p>
<br><p>The story was believed by many other newspapers, and a group of Professors 
from Yale. The mention of Herschel's name gave the story credibility. 
It was of course a hoax. Sir John Herschel knew nothing about
 it, and he had no assistant named Grant. The story had been made up by
 journalist named Richard Adams Locke (a relative of John Locke)

<br><br>Ex Nasa  employee Ken Johnston has accused NASA of covering up photographic evidence  of Alien artefacts on the moon. Full story and photographs at

The photos fromAmerican and Russianspace missions, include a glowing crater in Aristarchus,a perfect pyramid and several  other objects which appear to be  man made. A sceptic might suggest that some of these objects are natural rock formations, and others  are in fact man made,space junk from earlier missions. One ofthe artefacts in a photo tken by a Russian probe, resembles a communist era post  hole auger. Had it perhaps been used for soil sampling?.

<b>Baron Munchausen's visit to the moon</B><br>
In <i>"Singular travels, campaigns and adventures of Baron Munchaussen". </i> </a>, 
the Baron visits the moon twice, the first time 
by vine (after spending the day herding <a href= "bees.html"> bees </a> 
out to pasture!). 
He returns to earth by lowering himself down on a rope tied to 
the point of the crescent moon. This story sounds a bit 
<a href = "Stairway.html"> shamanic </a>.
Another time his ship is blown there during a storm off Tahiti, and he 
meets the inhabitants of the moon, who are known as "cooking animals", 
because of their eating habits: they feast once a month (becoming full!) and
 fast the rest of the time. They also have detachable heads and 
<a href = "wadjet.html"> eyes </a>, 
are covered from head to foot in scales, grow on trees, 
have only one finger on each hand and 
go into battle riding three headed vultures, armed with giant asparagus spears, 
and mushrooms for shields. Some of this is familiar lunar symbolism, 
but other things are obscure (why only one finger?).  
 In the film version by Terry Gilliam </a> 
(one of the most extravagant turkeys of all time, but hugely enjoyable),
 the king of the moon was played by Robin Williams, who was for some reason 
uncredited. In another adventure, the 
Baron meets a tribe in central Africa, whom he claims originally came from the moon 
(the proof of this, he said can be found on a pyramid at the source of the river Niger<a href="#**">**</a>)
Some African legends speak of people living on the moon <a href="Bibliography.html#tlp">[6]</a>.<br><br>
The stories were first published anonymously, and then added to 
by later 
authors. <br><p>The story of the baron's first journey to the moon is said to have
 been inspired by
 an old Serbian story entitled "The biggest liar in the world", 
and also by <a href="godwin.html">"The Man in the Moone"</a>, 
by Bishop Francis Godwin.. 
(Click here for similar stories from 
<a href="Thats_a_story.html">Scandinavia</a> and 
<a href="liar.html">Ireland </a>).
 Many other ideas in the stories have been borrowed from
 earlier folktales.  <br><a name="3"><a name="4">
The original stories were probably written by Rudolph Eriche Raspe 
(who incidentally had <a href="Set.html"> red hair </a>), 
to satirise the life of  
Hieronymous Karl Friederich Freiherr von Munchausen, who was still alive at the 
time that they were published. Raspe, a former freemason, who had fled up
from his creditors in Prussia, following a dishonourable career in science, 
punctuated by embezlement and fraud, came to England,
 where he was befriended by Matthew Boulton, one of the founder members of the 
<a href= "Erasmus.html"> Birmingham Lunar Society</a><a href="#***">*** </a>. Boulton had just 
industrialised Birmingham (although William Herschell was also apparently responsible-
 see note below) and had turned his attention to the Cornish tin 
industry. Raspe a former geologist was put in charge of modernising the mines, 
and so he was able to disappear for a few years. During this time, he probably 
wrote the stories of Baron Munchausen<a href="#****">****</a><a href="Bibliography2.html#tlp">[9]</a>. 
The badge of the tin miners guild of the West Country was three rabbits or 
<a href="toad_and_hare.html">hares</a> (click <a href="tinner.html">here</a> for picture).

*William Herschel lived for 81 earth years or one Uranian year. 
He also believed in life on the moon<a href="Bibliography2.html#tlp">[15]</a>.
In case you're wondering, Uranus was the Greek god of the sky, and the name is 
sometimes spelt (and pronounced) Ouranos. 
Herschel had originally intended to 
call it "George" in honour of the King, and for many years it 
was known as "Herschel". Astrologers associate the planet with
 sudden change and revolution, and say that Uranus had no 
influence prior to it's discovery (which is just as well, 
because earlier astrologers should have known about it if it did). 
The French, American, Industrial and Agricultural revolutions all occurred
 around the time of its discovery. Uranus can actually be seen 
sometimes with the naked eye, but it is so faint that it was probably 
never recognised as a planet before Herschel. <p>
In Greek myth, Uranus is 
not rebellious, if anything, he represents the status quo: Uranus' son Saturn 
(identified with the Greek Cronos or time who may or may not be a moon god) 
rebelled against his father and castrated him with a sickle. 
<br>
Anyway the point is that Herschel was not an astrologer, and  the name 
"Uranus" seems to have been chosen at random from any number of possible
 Greek deities. 
I have never heard any astrologer's suggestions about what the correct 
name for this planet should be. The same could be said of Neptune and Pluto.
Neptune (the sea god) is now appropriately enough the ruler of Pisces, but 
was the name chosen by astronomers or astrologers? Pluto, it is rumoured,
 was named at the request of the discoverer's young daughter, who may have had 
the cartoon dog in mind rather than the god of the underworld and wealth.
 Or doesn't it matter? If a new planet was discovered and named "Minerva", would the people of
the world become a sober, wiser place? and if the same planet was named "Bacchus", would
 this lead to an outbreak of wild parties? If there is another planet to be 
discovered, this could be the sort of 
testable hypothesis that would change astrology from pseudoscience into science.
 David Icke <a href="Bibliography2.html#tlp">[7]</a> claims that there is such a planet and that it is called 
Persephone, so is it already having an influence,
 or only on readers of his books? <br><br>And finally, should astronomers take more 
care in future, after all Herschel senior seems to have been responsible for among other things,

the guilotine, the enclosures act, acid rain and chewing gum 
(O.K. I know archaeologists have found stone age resin with adolescent 
teeth marks in it, and the Aztecs chewed <i>chicle</i>, but I'm sure it would
 never be marketed in an English colony) 
Perhaps human rights groups, ramblers, environmentalists and bus companies could 
team up with concerned astrologers, to prevent tragedies like 
these from happening again in future, by curbing new astronomical research?
