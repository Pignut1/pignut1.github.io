Me thought they did me beate and binde,<br> 
And took my bow mee froe;<br>
If I be Robin a-live in this lande,<br>
I'le be wrocken on both them towe."<br>.<br>
<a name="5">
"Sweavens are swift<a href="#*****">*****</a> master",quoth John,<br>
"As the wind that blows ore a hill;<br>
For if itt be never soe lowde this night,<br> 
To-morrow it may be still."<br>.<br>

"Buske yee, bowne yee, my merry men all,<br>
For John shall, goe with mee;<br>
For I'le goe seeke yond wight yeomen<br>
In greenwood where they bee."<br>.<br>

The(y) cast on their gowne of greene,<br> 
a shooting gone are they,<br>
Untill they came to the merry greenwood,<br> 
Where they had gladdest bee;<br>.<br>

They were the ware of [a] wight yeoman,<br>
His body leaned to a tree.<br>.<br>
<a name="6">
A sword and a dagger he wore by his side,<br>
Had beene many a mans bane,<br>
And he was clad in his capull-hyde,<a href="#******">******</a><br>
Topp, and tayle and mayne.<br>.<br>

"Stand you still, master,"quoth Litle John,<br>
"Under this trusty tree,<br>
And I will goe to yond wight yeoman,<br>
To know his meaning trulye"<br>.<br>

"A, John, by me thou sets noe store,<br> 
And thats a Farley thinge;<br>
How offt send I my men beforre<br> 
And tarry my-selfe behinde?<br>.<br>

"It is noe cunning a knave to ken, <br>
And a man but heare him speake;<br>
And itt were not for bursting of my bowe,<br>
John, I wold thy head breake"<br>.<br>

But often words they breeden bale,<br>
That parted Robin and John;<br>
John is gone to Barnesdale,<br>
The gates he knows eche one.<br>.<br>

And when hee came to Barnesdale,<br>
Great heavinesse there hee hadd;<br>
He found two of his fellowes<br>
were slaine both in a slade,<br>.<br>

And Scarlett a foote flyinge was,<br> 
Over stockes and stone,<br> 
For the sheriffe with seven score men<br>
Fast after him is gone.<br>.<br>

"Yett one shot, I'le shoote, says Litle John,<br>
"With Crist his might and mayne;<br>
I'le make yon fellow that flyes soe fast<br>
To be both glad and faine."<br>.<br>

John bent up a good yiewe bow<br>
And fettled him to shoote;<br>
The bow was made of a tender boughe,<br>
And fell downe to his foote.<br>.<br>

"Woe worth thee wicked wood",sayd Litle John,<br>
That ere thou grew on a tree!<br>
For this day thou art my bale,<br> 
My boote when thou shold bee!"<br>.<br>

This shoote it was but looselye shot,<br>
The arrowe flew in vaine,<br>
And it hit one of the sheriffes men;<br>
Good William a Trent was slaine.<br>.<br>
It had beene better for William a Trent<br>
To hange upon a gallowe<br>
Then for to lye in the greenwoode,<br>
There slaine with an arrowe.<br>.<br>

And it is sayd when men be mett,<br>
Six can doe more than three:<br>
And they have tane Litle John,<br>
And bound him fast to a tree.<br>.<br>

"Thou shalt be drawen by dale and downe," quote the sheriffe,<br>
"And hanged hye on a hill:"<br>
"But thou may fayle,"quoth Litle John,<br>
"If itt be Christs owne will."<br>.<br>

Let us leave talking of Litle John,<br>
For hee is bound fast to a tree,<br>
And talke of Guy and Robin Hood,<br>
In the green woode where they bee.<br>.<br>

How these two yeomen together they mett,<br>
Under the leaves of lyne,<br>
To see what merchandise they made<br>
Even at that same time.<br>.<br>

"Good morrow, good fellow," quoth Sir Guy:<br>
"Good morrow, good fellow,"quoth hee;<br>
"Me thinkes by this bow thou beares in thy hand,<br> 
A good archer thou seems to bee."<br>.<br>

"I am wilful of my way,"quoth Sir Guye,<br>
"And of my morning tyde:"<br>
"I'le lead thee through the wood,"quoth Robin,<br>
"Good fellow, I'le be thy guide."<br>.<br>

I seeke an outlaw,"quoth Sir Guye,<br>
"Men call him Robin Hood;<br>
I had rather meet with him upon a day<br>
Than forty pound of golde."<br>.<br>

"If you tow mett it wold be seene whether were better<br>
Afore yee did part awaye;<br>
Let us some other pastime find,<br>
Good fellow,I thee pray.<br>.<br>

"Let us some other masteryes make,<br>
And wee will walk in the woods even;<br>
Wee may chance meet with Robin Hoode<br>
At some unsett steven."<br>.<br>

They cut them down the summer shroggs<br>
Which grew both under a bryar,<br>
And sett them three score rood in twinn,<br>
To shoot the prickes full neare.<br>.<br>

"Leade on good fellow," sayd Sir Guye,<br>
"Lead on, I doe bidd thee:"<br>
"Nay by my faith,"quoth Robin Hood,<br>
The leader thou shalt bee."<br>.<br>

The first good shoot that Robin ledd<br>
Did not shoot an inch the pricke froe;<br>
Guy was an archer good enoughe,<br>
But he cold never shoote soe.<br>.<br>

The seconde shoote Sir Guy shott,<br>
He shott within the garlande;<br>
But Robin Hoode shott itt better than hee, <br>
For he clove the good pricke-wande,<br>.<br>

"Gods blessing on thy heart!" sayes Guye,<br>
"Goode fellow, thy shooting is goode;<br>
For an thy hart be as good as thy hands, <br>
Thou were better than Robin Hood<br>.<br>

"Tell me thy name, good fellow,"quoth Guy,<br>
Under the leaves of lyne:"<br>
"Nay, by my faith,"quoth good Robin,<br>
"Till thou have told me thine."<br>.<br>

"I dwell by dale and downe," quoth Guye,<br>
"And I have done many a curst turne;<br>
And he that calls me by my right name<br>
Calls me Guy of good Gysbourne."<br>.<br>

"My dwelling is in the wood,"sayes Robin;<br>
"By thee I set right nought;<br>
My name is Robin Hood of Barnesdale,<br>
A fellow thou has long sought."<br>.<br>

He that had neither beene a kithe nor kin<br>
Might have seen a full fayre sight,<br>
To see how together these yeomen went, <br>
With blades both browne and bright<br>.<br>

To have seene how these yeomen together fought,<br>
Two howers of a summers day;<br>
Itt was neither Guy nor Robin Hood<br>
That fettled them to flye away.<br>.<br>
Robin was reacheles on a roote,<br>
And stumbled at that tyde,<br>
And Guy was quicke and nimble withall,<br>
And hitt him ore the left side.<br>.<br>

"Ah, deere Lady!" sayd Robin Hoode,<br>
"Thou art both mother and may!<br>
I thinke it was never mans destinye<br>
To dye before his day."<br>.<br>
<a name="7">
Robin thought on Our Lady deere,<br>
And soone leapt up againe,<br>
And thus he came with an awkwarde<a href="#*******">*******</a> stroke;<br>
Good Sir Guy hee has slayne.<br>.<br>

He tooke Sir Guys head by the hayre,<br>
And sticked itt on his bowes end:<br>
"Thou hast beene traytor all thy liffe,<br>
Which thing must have an ende."<br>.<br>

Robin pulled forth an Irish kniffe,<br>
And nicked Sir Guy in the face,<br>
That he was never on a woman borne<br>
Cold tell who Sir Guy was.<br>.<br>

Saies, "Lye there, lye there, good Sir Guye,<br>
And with me be not wrothe;<br>
If thou have had the worse strokes at my hand,<br>
Thou shalt have the better cloathe."<br>.<br>

Robin did off his gowne of greene,<br>
Sir Guye he did it throwe;<br>
And he put on that capull-hyde,<br>
That clad him toppe to toe.<br>.<br>

"The bowe, the arrowes, and litle horne,<br>
And with me now I'll beare;<br>
For now I go to Barnesdale,<br>
To see how my men do fare."<br>.<br>

Robin sett Guyes horne to his mouth,<br>
A lowd blast in it he did blow;<br>
That beheard the sheriffe of Nottingham,<br>
As he leaed under a lowe.<br>.<br>

"Hearken! hearken! sayd the sheriffe<br>
"I heard noe tydings but good;<br>
For yonder I heare Sir Guyes horne blow,<br>
For he hath slaine Robin Hoode.<br>.<br>

"For yonder I heare Sir Guyes horne blow,<br>
Itt blowes soe well in tyde,<br>
For yonder comes that wighty yeoman,<br>
Cladd in his capull-hyde.<br>.<br>

Come hither, thou good Sir Guye,<br>
Aske of me what thou wilt have:"<br>
"I'le none of thy gold sayes Robin Hood,<br>
Nor I'll none of it have.<br>.<br>

But now I have slaine the master," he sayd,<br>
"Let me goe strike the knave;<br>
This is all the reward I aske,<br>
Nor noe other will I have."<br>.<br>

"Thou art a madman,"said the shiriffe,<br>
"Thou sholdest have had a knights fee;<br>
Seeing thy asking [hath] been soe badd,<br>
Well granted it shall be."<br>.<br>

But Litle John heard his master speake,<br>
Well he knew that was his steven;<br>
Now shall I be loset," quoth litle John,<br>
With Christs might in heaven"<br>.<br>

But Robin hee hyed him towards Litle John,<br>
Hee thought hee wold loose him believe;<br>
The sheriffe and all his companye<br>
fast after him did drive.<br>.<br>

"Stand abacke! strand abacke!" sayd Robin;<br>
"Why draw you mee soe neere?<br>
Itt was never the use in our countrye<br>
One's shrift another shoul heere.<br>.<br>

But Robin pulled forth an Iryshe kniffe,<br>
And losed John hand and foote,<br>
And gave him Sir Guyes bow in his hand,<br>
And bade it be his boote<br>.<br>

But John tooke Sir Guyes bow in his hand-<br>
His arrowes were rawstye buy the roote-,<br>
The sheriffe saw Litle John draw a bow<br>
And fettle him to shoote.<br>.<br>

Towards his house in Nottingham<br>
He fled full fast away,<br>
And so did all his companye,<br>
Not one behind did stay.<br>.<br>

But he could neither soe fast goe,<br>
Noraway soe fast runn,<br>
But Litle John, with an arrow broade,<br>
Did cleave his heart in twinn.<br>.<br>


  
 <a name="**">
**woodweele = green woodpecker <a href="Bibliography.html#gisbourne">[3]
</a> - Lincoln green plumage
 and a red crest. The university of Rochester page
 (link below)
 translates "Woodweele" as Golden Oriole (a summer migrant)[<a href="#2">back</a>]<br><br>
<a name="***">
***Lyne = Linden or Lime, this tree is traditionally 
associated with midsummer <a href="Bibliography.html#gisbourne">[2]</a>. 
The mother
 of Cheiron the centaur (half man, half horse) was called 
Philyra, which means "lime tree". She was apparently transformed into 
a lime tree by Zeus. In upland areas, the "tree" of midsummer was 
<a href = "heather.html"> heather </a> (ling?)[<a href="#3">back</a>]<br><br>
<a name="****">
****wight = strong, fast, courageous, skilled in arms, vigourous. Also applied (as
a noun) to supernatural or unearthly beings. <a href="Bibliography.html#gisbourne">[3]</a>[<a href="#4">back</a>]<br><br>
<a name="*****">
*****John seems to be saying that dreams are fleeting and should not be taken too
 seriously. Presumably, in the missing section of the ballad,
 Robin talks about a disturbing dream which 
he has had. Perhaps, like <a href="sculpture.html"> The Sorrowful God</a>, 
Robin knows what awaits him[<a href="#5">back</a>]<br><br>
