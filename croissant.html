<H1>Croissants</H1>I read somewhere that croissants were originally offerings to 
the moon goddess. The word is French for "crescent" (although the French 
apparently learnt the recipe from the Austrians). This sounds a little bit 
unlikely to me, but probably not as unlikely as the following theory: 
<BR><BR>Centuries ago, Budapest (or possibly Vienna) was being besieged by the 
Turks. A group of bakers heard the sound of the Turks tunnelling under the 
walls, and alerted the army. As a reward, they were allowed to bake pastries in 
the shape of the Islamic crescent symbol (see the <A 
href="calendar.html">Lunar Calendar</A> page 
for info on the Islamic lunar calendar).<BR><BR><A name=1>I got this story from 
the link below, which didn't quote its sources. It seems more likely to me that 
the city was actually captured, and the bakers started producing crescent shaped 
pastries for the Turks when they weren't too busy praying towards Mecca and 
memorising the Koran. It's what I would have done.<A
