<h3>By William Topaz McGonagal</h3>
<h4>(possibly the worst poet in the world, ever)</h4><br>

               Beautiful Moon, with thy silvery light,<br>
               Thou seemest most charming to my sight;<br>
               As I gaze upon thee in the sky so high,<br>
               A tear of joy does moisten mine eye. <br><br>

               Beautiful Moon, with thy silvery light,<br>
               Thou cheerest the Esquimau in the night;<br>
               For thou lettest him see to harpoon the fish,<br>
               And with them he makes a dainty dish.<br><br> 

               Beautiful Moon, with thy silvery light,<br>
               Thou cheerest the fox in the night,<br>
               And lettest him see to steal the grey goose away<br>
               Out of the farm-yard from a stack of hay. <br><br>

               Beautiful Moon, with thy silvery light,<br>
               Thou cheerest the farmer in the night,<br>
               and makes his heart beat high with delight<br>
               As he views his crops by the light in the night. <br><br>

               Beautiful Moon, with thy silvery light,<br>
               Thou cheerest the eagle in the night,<br>
               And lettest him see to devour his prey<br>
               And carry it to his nest away. <br><br>

               Beautiful Moon, with thy silvery light,<br>
               Thou cheerest the mariner in the night<br>
               As he paces the deck alone,<br>
               Thinking of his dear friends at home. <br><br>

               Beautiful Moon, with thy silvery light,<br>
               Thou cheerest the weary traveller in the night;<br>
               For thou lightest up the wayside around<br>
               To him when he is homeward bound. <br><br>

               Beautiful Moon, with thy silvery light,<br>
               Thou cheerest the lovers in the night<br>
               As they walk through the shady groves alone,<br>
               Making love to each other before they go home.<br><br> 

               Beautiful Moon, with thy silvery light,<br>
               Thou cheerest the poacher in the night;<br>
               For thou lettest him see to set his snares<br>
               To catch the rabbit and the hares.<br><br></center>

McGonagal's verses inspired <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Academy/1119">

Beautiful moon, with thy silvery light,<br>
Smiling so sweetly down through the night<br>
With a blessing of love shown in your eyes<br>
Fill me with longing and heartfelt sighs.<br><br>

Beautiful moon, with thy silvery light<br>
I gaze at your beauty given this night<br>
Swollen from birthing, a pure mother love<br>
A gift from our goddess shining above<br><br></center>

<h2>Your Moon</h2> 
<h3>A Love Letter to Endymion</h3> 
<b>by <a href=" http://moonraven.moonraven.net">moon raven</a></b> <br><br>

 
I awake every day to darkness, <br>
cast my mournful blue hue <br>
Upon your cheek. <br>
I am forever to be <br>
only your light <br>
In the dark. <br>
With you I have <br>
no hands <br>
no body<br> 
no mouth -<br> 
Just my melancholy blue. <br>
I shine to remind you <br>
how much -<br> 
Oh, so very much<br> 
I long to sprout <br>
arms,<br> 
legs,<br> 
body,<br> 
flesh - <br>
To thrust my tongue <br>
inside your mouth and taste the <br>
Sweetness of it <br>
Like a ripe gala apple<br> 
red and shiney. <br>
Alas...<br> 
no arms,<br> 
no legs,<br> 
no body,<br> 
no flesh,<br> 
no kisses<br> 
Of mine will <br>
Ever land upon you.<br> 
Only my light - <br>
my reflective light -<br> 
Can cast a shadow<br> 
by your side. <br>
There I walk with you always, <br>
Casting <br>
your hands,<br> 
your legs,<br> 
your body<br> 
to the ground or wall.<br> 
Bend a knee one day, my love, <br>
to touch your lowly shadow - <br>
You will have touched me...<br> 
Your Moon<br><br></center><a href="#top">[top]</a>
