moon is all this and more. Eclipsed it drips <A

is a <A href="medusa.html">decapitating 
sickle</A>, or a <A

sun like an egg. It has been visited many times, by <A

For safety reasons this site should be taken in small doses with an occasional 
pinch of salt. <BR><BR>The object of this page is to collect information about 
the moon. Some parts of this site may have little or nothing to do with the 
moon. Please bear with me. I tend to ramble, but I do have a lot to say, and 
normally it only gets said late at night after too many pints, so if it seems 
confused, that's because it is. <BR><BR>If you know anything about the moon, or 
if you know how Michael Stipe seems to know all this stuff already, or if your 
web page is relevant to any of this, or if you've found dead links please <A 
href="mailto:pignut@altavista.net">E-Mail me</A>. <BR><BR>Recently I have 
discovered several of my pages reproduced elsewhere on the web. I don't mind 
this (imitation is the sincerest form of flattery after all :-) ), but if you 
wish to use any of this material, please <A 
href="mailto:driansanders@yahoo.com">consult me</A> first, and be sure to put in a 
link back to this site. <BR><BR>
