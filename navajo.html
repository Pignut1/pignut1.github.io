<H1>The Navajo Message to the Moon</H1><BR>
<H3>(possibly apocryphal)</H3>
<P>
<P>'A few years back when NASA was preparing for the Apollo project, they did 
some astronaut training on a Navajo Indian reservation. When the Navajo Indians 
found out about it, they asked if they could send a message to the moon on the 
Apollo. NASA spindoctors happily agreed (dreaming sweetly about the free 
propaganda!), and quickly arranged to record a message of an elder. With the 
recording completed, NASA asked what the message said, the Navajo elder smiled 
and said nothing. Intrigued, the NASA men played the recording to several 
Indians in an attempt to find out what the message said, but the Indians would 
only laugh and refused to translate the elder's message to the moon. Finally, 
NASA called in an official government translator. He reported that the moon 
message said, "Watchout for these guys; they've come to steal your 
land".'<BR><BR>Taken from <A
