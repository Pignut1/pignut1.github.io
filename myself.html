<H1>About the author</H1>Ian was found in 1976, in a silk chrysalis on top of <A 
href="http://www.isleofavalon.co.uk/"><B>Glastonbury Tor</A></B>, England. 
Nearby was an illustrated <A 
href="horo2.html">horoscope</A>, which 
indicated that he had been born (or possibly hatched) on July 11th of that year; 
and a note which read simply: <I>"<A 
href="elf.html">changeling</A> do not 
disturb"</I>. He was delivered to social services who arranged for him to be 
adopted.<BR><BR>He was educated at St Frodoberts School for the severely 
bemused, but ran away at the age of 16, to join the Space Cadets. Soon after, 
during routine training, he became separated from the rest of his squadron, and 
was marooned on the dark side of the moon, where he remained for several months 
surviving on a diet of <A href="http://www.clangers.co.uk/"><B>clangers</B></A> 
and mash.<A name=1><BR><BR>Eventually, his distress flares were spotted by a 
travelling sales team from the star system of Vega. The Vegans took him to a 
remote part of Devon, England where they could land their craft without 
attracting too much attention. It was there that he discovered a previously 
unknown tribe of hunter gatherers, whom he lived with and studied for about a 
year. The tribe initiated him into their most secret ceremonies, and conferred 
upon him the honorary title of <I>"Pignut"</I>, the name of one of their most 
valued food plants<A

spends most of his time exploring time, space and his own head to research this 
site. He can be contacted by pigeon post, telepathy, email (driansanders[at]yahoo.com) or through the <a href="index.html">guestbook</a>.<BR><BR>

<B>Names:</B> They are called earth-nuts, earth-chesnuts, ground-nuts, ciper 
nuts, and in Sussex <B>pig-nuts</B>. A description of them were needless, for 
every child knows them.<BR>Government and virtues: They are something hot and 
dry in quality, under the dominion of Venus; they provoke lust exceedingly, and 
stir up those sports she is mistress of; the seed is excellent good to provoke 
urine; and so also is the root, but it does not perform it so forcibly as the 
seed doth. The root being dried and beaten into powder, and the powder being 
made into an electuary, is a singular remedy for spitting and pissing of blood, 
as the former chesnut was for coughs.</I><BR><BR>Taken from <I>Culpeper's
