name=1>The moon seems to have been the earliest measurement of time. The word 
"moon" probably comes from a sanskrit word meaning "measurer" The Greeks 
personified time as Chronos<A 
href="#*">*</A>, who wielded a 
crescent sickle or scythe. <A name=2>The Egyptian god of time was Thoth, who was 
also a moon god. Thoth was represented either with the head of a baboon or an 
ibis<A 
href="#**">**</A>.<BR><BR>Later 
on, astronomers and astrologers found themselves with the headache of trying to 
reconcile the lunar calendar with a solar calendar. This was not easy because 
the number of lunar months in a solar year is not a whole number, and full moons 
do not fall on the same dates each year, so complicated mathematics was 
required. Patrick Moore <A 
href="#calendar">[3]</A> 
believes that it was a mistake to measure time by the moon at all, and the 
ancients would have been better off if they had used a purely solar calendar 
from the start. A purely solar calendar would simply measure time by the number 
of days since the winter solstice. It would have no months. For a clearer 
definition of the different types of calendar, see the link below (Types of 
calendar).<BR><BR>Our own calendar (The Gregorian calendar) has "months" of 28, 
30 or 31 days, which divide up the year from one winter solstice to the next. 
The timing of the months is not influenced by the phases of the moon, so it is 
to all intents and purposes, a solar calendar. The only remnant of lunar time 
(to my knowledge), is Easter, the date of which depends on the full moon (more 
on this later). The reason for this is that the bible states that the 
crucifiction of Christ took place shortly after the Jewish festival of Passover, 
the date of which is determined by the moon. Easter is named after the Saxon moon goddess <A 
href="toad_and_hare.html#hare">Eostre</A>. 
<BR><BR>The Dead sea scrolls reveal that the community at Qumran used a lunar 
calendar. <BR><BR>The Moslem religious calendar, is based solely on the moon. 
The month of Ramaddan begins on the ninth new moon. The calendar takes no 
account of the solar year, so Ramaddan can occur in any season. <BR><BR>The 
calendars which I have reproduced below (and the Dakota calendar which I have 
linked to) are technically known as observation based calendars. They are not 
written down and require no complicated calculations, They take account of the 
solar year, in so far as it can be deduced from the flowering of plants, the 
weather etc., but they do not precisely record the equinoxes and solstices as a 
solar calendar would. This is an important distinction, because the timing of 
natural phenomena is sometimes influenced by the moon, as well as by the season 
of the solar year:<BR>For example, the mating of the palolo worms is (or was) a 
key event in the Banks Islanders' year. It occurs at three full moons in late 
summer. Similarly, many people around the world have (rightly or wrongly) 
planted each crop at a certain phase of a particular moon. The date of Easter 
may be a remnant of this practice. There is some evidence that wheat grows 
fastest at the Easter full moon. The weather may also be influenced by the phase 
of the moon, and the tides certainly are. (see the <A 
href="Lunar_gardening.html">Lunar 
gardening</A> page for more on this). Needless to say, these calendars are not 
very precise.<BR><BR>If anyone knows more about other calendars, please leave a message in the 
<a href="index.html">guestbook</A><BR><BR>The <A 
href="moonmyth1.html#polynesia">Polynesian 
Lunar Calendar</A> deals with days of the month, rather than months of the year, 
so I have not included it here. My information is aproximately 70-100 years out 
of date, so by now these people may have abandoned their traditional ways of 
life and scrapped their lunar/nature based calendars for something more 
scientific and less poetic. If you know any more about these cultures, please leave a message in the <A

<H2>The Ba-Ila lunar calendar</H2>The Ba-Ila live in Northern Zimbabwe. They 
live by a combination of farming and hunting. They tell stories about <A 
href="toad_and_hare.html#hare">Hare</A> the 
trickster, which are remarkably similar to the stories told by Uncle Remus about 
Brer rabbit. Their year is divided into three seasons: Chidimo, the cultivation 
period, or Spring; Mainza, the rainy season; and Mweto or winter. The 
transitions between the seasons are known as kungosoka, or change of season. The 
names of the lunar months within these seasons are given below, along with their 
aproximate translations:<BR><BR>
<H3>Chidimo</H3><BR><B>Kauhumbi kashonto</B> - The time of new grass and 
leaves<BR><B>Iuhumbi ikando</B> - The time of full grass and 
leaves<BR><B>Shimwenje</B> - When the rains are fully developed<BR><BR>
<H3>Mainza</H3><BR><B>Kukazhi</B> - The womens month, i.e. when they are busy 
weeding<BR><B>Kuyoba</B> - The time of continued rain - also known 
as:<BR><B>Kulumi</B> - The men's month, i.e when the men are out 
hunting<BR><B>Itaano</B> - "Pass here" i.e. "come and get food, there is 
plenty!"<BR><B>Chisangule</B> - The time of change i.e. rains are lessening - 
also known as:<BR><B>Chibuantimba</B> - The time of little 
rain<BR><B>Inkombolabulezhi</B> - The breaking of the pleiades<BR><BR>
<H3>Mweto</H3><BR><B>Ikonaula masanga</B> - The breaking of the long 
grass<BR><B>Kazhalakonze</B> - When the hartebeeste calves - also known 
as:<BR><B>Kaabanino</B> - Change in the season, beginning to get warm - 
or:<BR><B>Kapukupuku</B> - Time of much wind<BR><B>Katente kashonto</B> - The 
time of the first veld fires<BR><B>Kasangabimbe</B> -When the first bimbe bird 
appears<BR><B>Katu</B> - The shooting of the first leaves <A

<H2>The Lunar Calendar of the Banks Islands</H2>The Banks Islands are part of 
Melanesia. The islanders live by growing vegetables such as yams and by fishing, 
esteeming very highly the palolo or "un", a marine annelid worm which masses on 
their beaches at full moon in late summer. The Islanders refer to the months by 
the work which they perform in that month, or the changes occuring in nature. 
There are about 30 names of months, so one month may be known by several names. 
Some of these months overlap each other. I suppose different names of months 
could be used in different years, depending on the timing of the full moons 
relative to natural phenomena. The calendar begins with the April moon.

<H2>Ian's Lunar Calendar</H2>These calendars are all very well for people whose 
lives revolve around the seasons in the savannah, or the mating of the Palolo, 
but they have very little relevance to people in the western world at the start 
of the twenty first century. For this reason I have devised this lunar calendar 
based around the seasonal activities which shape my life in Scotland. The year 
begins shortly after the festive 
season:<BR><BR><B>Oomi-frigin-ed</B> The month following the great hangover. 
Half price sale at B&amp;Q<BR><B>Sqwurt-de-dubyoodee-forti</B> The month of 
bicycle maintenance<BR><B>Cud-fynda-yoos-fur-dat-sumday</B> The month in which 
spring cleaning takes place. Dumpsters brim full with fascinating bric-a-brac. 
Imaginative new uses are found for broken furniture, bicycle frames, carpet and 
potentially hazardous electrical appliances.<BR><B>Oomi-frigin-bak</B> The month 
of vegetable planting<BR><B>Digup-de-grownd-elda-an-kooch</B> The month of 
weeding<BR><B>Shed-dem-thermals</B> The month in which the (relatively) warm 
weather begins<BR><B>Tokum-trippi-weed</B> The month of summer 
festivals<BR><B>Wek-up-an-pass-de-sider</B> The month of picnics and long 
siestas<BR><B>Scoff-dem-sillysibins</B> The month when the first mushrooms 
appear<BR><B>S'allrite-iffyer-nokitbak-cwiq</B> The month when the home-made 
wine is first tasted<BR><B>Braaaaarp-scyoose-me</B> The month of the turnip 
harvest. Also known as:<BR><B>Mucho-flatyoolenss</B> The month of the great 
wind<BR><B>wizzboom-all-frigin-nite</B> The month in which small children, in 
time honoured fashion, set light to mixtures of fertiliser, sugar and petrol and 
go on the rampage, intimidating adults and household pets, with their demands 
for money and sweets.<BR><B>Bye-dis-bye-dat-ownli-twennti-shopin-dez-lef</B> The 
month of consumerism leading up to the midwinter festival<BR>:-) [<A
