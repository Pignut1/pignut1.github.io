<h1>The Fool on the Moon</h1>
<br><br>
<h2>Who is a fool? </h2>

 You haven't heard of Occlève Siméon, the first man
 to visit the moon? I know, I know. You think Neil
 Armstrong was the first, flying through space in his
 lunar lander. But as poet-journalist Dany Laferrière
 has pointed out, Armstrong arrived only to find a
 Haitian peasant already waiting. <br><br>

 "I haven't had a cigarette for three days," the peasant
 said, according to Laferrière's sources. "Do you
 know what that's like for a smoker?" We shouldn't be
 surprised to find The Fool on the moon. For him, it was the perfect
job. America
 had reached its crowning moment of ego, and needed to be deflated. Even
more
 importantly, the world needed a reminder that an epic journey of
spirit-a
 metaphysical flight-can take you much farther than to a rock in outer
space. The
 Haitians, living in the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, knew
exactly
 how to bring America down to Earth. "That's a mighty big rocket you've
got there,
 Uncle Sam," they said. "Is it as big as the mind? As free as
imagination?" <br><br>

 The tale is heavy with festivity and fantasy, the twin pillars of
foolery. The pillars
 stand on a foundation of greed, arrogance, authority, pride, all those
"pitiful little
 tricks and handsprings." These are the acts of real fools, without
which The Fool
 would be useless and mute. <br><br>

 The Fool is a looking-glass. She is male and female, he is human and
animal,
 they are one moment immersed in the workaday routine and the next
overturning
 the norms of daily life. When we play The Fool, we are The Other,
strangers who
 are in this world but not entirely of it. The ancient term
Narrenfreiheit means
 "freedom of the fool." That freedom reminds us that in a moment of
ecstasy we
 can sweep away the illusion of so much of what we endure. The Fool
breaks the
 trail; the revolutionaries follow. "World-changers need not be joyless
and
 ascetic," writes Harvey Cox, author of Feast of Fools. The original
Feast of Fools
 was a medieval tradition, older even than the age of court jesters that
turned their
 pitiful tricks for those in power. In the Feast, priests would don rude
masks, pious
 citizens would discard and ridicule cherished rituals, underlings would
parade in
 the robes of rulers. Often, the day of festivity would spill over into
a week.
 Authorities constantly condemned the feast, and it faded some 500 years
ago. <br><br>

 The tradition, though, has traveled through the underground, nourished
by Fools
 from hundreds of cultures. In the past century, we've seen Dada and the
 surrealists; the situationist vision of the city-as-funhouse; the beat
poets, Yippie
 pranksters, punk artists and drag queen parades. And now, once again,
The Fool
 is on the rise, stiltwalking and firebreathing over the heads of
corporate culture. <br><br>

 The Feast of Fools was celebrated at the start of each new year. Now we
stand at
 the start of a new millennium. What better time to revive The Fool's
spirit?
 Imagine the sweet chaos of a single day dedicated to popping a
jack-in-the-box
 in the face of the global elite. How will society cope with 24 hours of
raw
 weirdness, a rain of pranks and unexpected public dreams? <br><br>

 let's return Fools Day to its rightful tradition: tweaking the nose of
 power and authority. Let's turn the world upside down, and see what
falls out the
 pockets. <br>
