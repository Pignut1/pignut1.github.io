George Ewart Evans <a href="Bibliography.html#toad_and_hare.html">[12]</a> 
suggests that these animals are hares rather than rabbits, 
because of their long ears, and that this is a pagan symbol. 
I suspect that they are rabbits (an appropriate symbol for miners).
However, a pagan origin for the Tinners Guild is not totally inconceivable. 
Tin Mining is possibly Britain's oldest industry: Greek and Phoenician 
merchants came to the South West of Britain 
(which they called the Cassiterides, or "Tin Islands"), to obtain tin.
The Tinner's link to the <a href="Erasmus.html">Birmingham Lunar Society</a>, 
through <a href="tlp.html#baron">Rudolph Erich Raspe</a> is also 
interesting.
