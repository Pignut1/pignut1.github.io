<H1>Frequently asked questions</H1><BR><B>Q</B> My teacher asked me to write a 
term paper on "The Kalevala" and it's now nearly the end of term, so I went to 
the library to get myself a copy, yesterday and I discovered it's this, like 
really massive book about 6 inches thick, so rather than actually reading it, I 
had a look on the web, but there was hardly anything about it except for this 
one page that said it was something to do with the moon or something, so what I 
really want to know is can you do my homework for me?<BR><BR><B>A</B> <I>I have 
the utmost sympathy with your predicament...... (*snigger*)...... <BR>Isn't the 
web a funny place? Just by writing a webpage with a certain word on it makes me 
a world expert. BUT if you have a specific question, or have useful comments 
about my site, I may be able to help or point you in the right direction. A far 
better approach would be something like this:<BR><BR>I am the great-grandson of 
the craftsman who made that weird <A 
href="hatstand.html">hatstand</A> that you 
were so interested in. He was a member of the freemasonic order of the <A 
href="croissant.html">croissant</A>, which had 
links to the <A href="Erasmus.html">Birmingham 
Lunar Society</A>, and which preserved the secret recipe for Pictish <A 
href="heather.html">heather beer</A>, which 
had been passed down through the ages. I think I've got the recipe in the attic 
somewhere......<BR>While I look for it, do you feel that the Kalevala as it 
stands is an accurate representation of age old Finnish epic poetry, or has it 
been influenced by late 19th century Finnish Nationalism?</I><BR><BR><B>Q</B> I

<I>Wow, that is incredible! I suspected as much all along. But where do <A 
href="Stairway.html">Led Zeppelin</A> fit into 
this? The thing about The Kalevala is that it had been an oral tradition for 
centuries before it was written down, and consequently the stories may have 
changed considerably in the telling and existed in many different versions. When 
the stories were written down in the late 19th century political bias crept in 
....</I> <BR><BR><B>Q</B> Why isn't there a calendar of planting dates for 
astrological gardeners?<BR><BR><B>A</B><I> There is considerable disagreement 
about which particular cosmic events will benefit or harm plants the most, and 
several systems in operation. Some of the websites I have linked to produce 
calendars like this (or did last time I looked). I don't have time to produce a 
calendar every year, but if you buy an almanac, you can work it out for 
yourself. Better still, buy a copy of "Planting by the moon" by Nick Kollerstrom 
(link on <A href="Lunar_gardening.html">Lunar 
Gardening page</A>)</I><BR><BR><B>Q</B> I live in the tropics and wish to make a 
sundial/moondial how should I go about this?<BR><BR><B>A</B><I> A sundial for 
the tropics will probably have to be rectangular rather than round, although 
there are a surprising variety of sundials in all shapes and sizes. My best 
advice is to get a copy of "Sundials: Their Theory and construction" by 
A.E.Waugh. Failing that, send me your latitude and I will try and work out some 
details for you. I did make a sundial suitable for the Falkland islands once, 
but that was only because I had the plans upside down :-)</I> <BR><BR><B>Q</B> 
Would you be interested in my page about......?<BR><BR><B>A</B><I>: If it has 
anything to do with the moon, or any other topic on these pages (or even if it 
doesn't), I will almost certainly be interested enough to give you a link. 
</I><BR><BR><B>Q</B> I think you are have got some/all of this site badly wrong. 
should I tell you?<BR><BR><B>A</B><I> Of course! I'm not an expert. Constructive 
criticism is always useful</I><BR><BR><B>Q</B> Can I use one of the pictures or 
some of the text from this site on my page?<BR><BR><B>A</B><I> Please contact me by leaving a message in the <A 
href="index.html"> guestbook</A> first (so I can link to you), 
and be sure to link back to this site. These pages are all added to from time to 
time, so it would probably be better to link to one of my pages, rather than 
duplicating it somewhere else</I><BR><BR><B>Q</B> Why don't you have any 
backgrounds/graphics/java script on your pages?<BR><BR><B>A</B><I> I believe 
that reading information on the internet should be as quick and easy as reading 
a book. This is why I have tried to keep my pages simple and quick to load. Many 
people (myself included) don't have access to computers which can cope with 
heavy graphics. I'm not an expert on html, so if anyone knows how I could make 
my pages faster, please leave a message in the <A href="index.html">guestbook</A>.</I>
