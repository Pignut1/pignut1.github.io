<h1>Moondials</h1>

<br>

I would strongly recommend 

<i>"Sundials their theory and construction."</i>

<a href="Bibliography2.html#Make_your_own_moondial">[3]</a>, if you are interested in

making moondials or sundials, as it has far more on different types of 

dial than I could ever fit onto this page, but here is a summary of what

you need to know:<br><br>

The simplest type of moondial is a sundial. This can only be used

at full moon,(I have only ever

made the horizontally mounted sort, but all designs of sundial

can be adapted as moondials) 

 

Simply read 12.00 as midnight rather than midday. 

<br><br>

The moons shadow will lose 48 minutes for every day after

full moon and will be equivalently fast before full moon. Some sundials have a table 

of corrections to allow them to be used as moondials.

<br><br>

Here are the corrections that have to be made during the weeks before and after

full moon:<br><br>

Days from full moon: 0.....1.....2.....3.....4.....5.....6.....7<br>

amount of correction<br>

(hours:minutes):.........0:0 0:48 1:36 2:24 3:12 4:0 4:48 5:36<br><br>

Alternatively, you could make a dial 

specially, with different scales 

for different days of the month. For example, a 7-day moondial should look

something like <a href = "lunardial.html"> this </a> (not to scale)<br><br> 

The moon casts a strong

enough shadow for

a few days before and after full moon. If you live in a city where there

are a lot of streetlights,the period of the month during which you can use

the moondial 

will be shorter. In remote rural areas, it may be possible to use a moondial

for up to half of the month. Moondials can be designed accordingly.<br><br>

<a name="1"><a name="2"><a name="3">

I make sun and moondials out of sheet copper, with

designs and hour markings etched on. The plinth can be obtained from your

local garden centre, where they will usually have suitable ornamental 

pillars, or something similar. Often, if you ask they will be able to 

supply you with the base from a bird bath, 

or know of a wholesaler who could supply you with any number of interesting 

pieces of reject stoneware . Don't worry if you don't have the equipment or 

enthusiasm for metalwork, the possibilities are endless. You 

could turn your entire garden into a moondial, by planting flowerbeds in 

concentric circles around a central post, tree or piece of topiary. 

Poppies<a href="#*">*</a>,

ornamental <a href="cabbage.html">cabbages</a> and lettuces, 

moon daisies<a href="#**">**</a>, moon carrots, Hawthorn,

willow, <a href="Moonshine.html">vines</a>, cucumbers, melons and many other plants are traditionally 

associated with the

moon (<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Nebula/7417/moon.html"><b>Psychowerewolf</b> </a>

has a more comprehensive list of lunar 

plants<a href="#***">***</a>. See also the link 

below. 

For more on lunar gardening, 

click <a href = "Lunar_gardening.html"> Here.</a>).

<br> 

<br> If you click <a href="sundial.html"> here </a> you will find the

angles for the hour markings for a sundial designed for your latitude.


These measurements for the sundial can be used for the full moon scale, 

and scales for the other days of the month can be calculated by adding or 

removing 48 minutes to each hour marking on the 

full moon/sun scale, for each day before or after full moon and arranging the

scales concentrically, in order, from

the earliest date before full moon to the latest date after full moon.

(e.g the scale for two days before full moon should be identical to the full

moon scale, except that every hour mark will be shifted out by 96 minutes

from the equivalent mark on the full moon scale)If you are 

lucky enough to live in an area where the moonlight is unsullied by neon,

you may find yourself requiring quite a large dial, in order to accomodate

all of the scales<br> (if you assume that 48 minutes

are 48/60ths of the separation between two hour markings, you won't be 

100% accurate, but it shouldn't make any difference except on an extremely 

large dial)

The size of the gnomond 

is not crucial either: If it is too big, the tip of the shadow will be off 

the edge of the dial, and if it's too small, it will not reach all the way 

to the hour markings, but as the elevation of the sun and moon changes from 

summer to winter, the length of the shadow will also vary. The average 

elevation of the sun is equal to 90 degrees minus your latitude, The moon's

elevation varies even more than the sun's, but on average is about the same.

On a horizontal sundial, the angle of the gnomond to the dial should be 

equal to your latitude.(this applies equally to horizontal or south facing 

vertical wall mounted dials)

<br>

(N.B. astronomy is not really my strong point, if I have got anything badly

wrong here, please <a href = mailto:pignut@altavista.net>E-MAIL ME </A> and tell me. My methods produce reasonably 

accurate sun and moondials, but you should be aware that the time which

watches and clocks show often deviates considerably from that shown on sun 

and moondials, especially around the equinoxes. This is because conventional

clocks only aproximate astronomical time. Sun and moondials will not, of 

course show British Summer Time, daylight saving time or other local 

interference by central government. Moondials also have many curious 

eccentricities and innacuracies of their own)<a href="Bibliography2.html#Make_your_own_moondial">[3]</a>

<br> <br>

There is also apparently another sort of moondial,used for black magic 

rather than timekeeping. Click <a href="curious.html"> here</a>

** The word "daisy" means literally "day's eye", because of the resemblance 

between the flower and the sun (click <a href="wadjet.html"> here </a> for 

more on the symbolism of the eye ). Common daisies close their flowers at night, 

I think that the moon daisy, ox-eye daisy or Marguerite does not, and this may be one reason

why it has aquired its

name. The similar May weed certainly stays open at night. 

In ancient times the moon-daisy was sacred to the moon goddess Artemis, 

and was prescribed for period pains. 

Later it was associated with Mary Magdalane, and was known as the Maudlin daisy.

In Somerset it was connected with the Thunder God and was called the Dun Daisy

<a href="Bibliography2.html#Make_your_own_moondial">[5]</a>. In parts of Africa 

there is a shrub with large daisy-like flowers, known as Fleur Marguerite.

I pressed one of the flowers as a souvenir on a visit to 

Cameroon. The plant is associated with mirages, and is apparently named after 

the goddess Margara, who seems to be <a href="The_White_Goddess.html"> The White Goddess </a> 

<a href="Bibliography2.html#Make_your_own_moondial">[2]</a>. I was completely 

unaware of this at the time, and it was pure synchronicity that I chose to press

the flower between the pages of 

<a href="The_White_Goddess.html"><i>"The White Goddess"</a></i> by Robert Graves.<br><br>

In <i>"Masquerade"</i> by Kit Williams, the violinist says, after the eclipse:<br><i>

"I shall play the Song of the Sun. The Sun is the <a href="wadjet.html"> eye </a>of day, and as long as I play this tune, the day's eye cannot close again."<br>

The man played the Song of the Sun so sweetly that it 

made the happy daisies grow."<br></i>

In the picture, the violinist is seated on a huge sow which has 

grass and 

daisies growing out of it, and 

there are cut <a href="Lunar_gardening.html"> cabbages </a>in 

the background.[<a href="#2">back</a>]<br><br>

***The BBC Gardeners Question Time Panel were asked what plants 

they would take to the moon. They suggested Paper moon iris, moon 

daisy, honesty, epiphylum cactus, rocket (groan), runner beans 

(because they are so useful and productive, but a 

<a href="Stairway.html">vine</a> seems appropriate),
