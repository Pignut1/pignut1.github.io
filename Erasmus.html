<H2>Erasmus Darwin</H2><BR>Erasmus Darwin (1731 to 1802, click <a href="edarwin.html">here</a>
 for picture), the grandfather of 
Charles Darwin and Francis Galton (the inventor of eugenics), was a poet, 
inventor and scientist. He had ideas about evolution which almost certainly 
influenced his grandsons. For example this piece on the beaks of birds, which 
sounds a lot like Chuck's work on the Galapagos finches:<BR><BR><I>"Some birds 
have acquired harder beaks to crack nuts, as the parrot. Others have acquired 
beaks adapted to break the harder seeds, as sparrows. Others for the softer 
seeds of flowers, or the buds of trees as the finches. Other birds have acquired 
long beaks to penetrate the moister soils in search of roots, as woodcocks; and 
others broad ones to filtrate the water of lakes, and to retain aquatic insects. 
All of which seem to have been gradually produced during many generations by the 
perpetual endeavour of the creatures to supply the want of food"</I> 
<BR>(<I>Zoonomia book I</I>)<BR>Much of his writing was in the form of eccentric 
poetry, like this from <I>The Temple of Nature</I>:<BR><BR><I>"Organic Life 
beneath the shoreless waves<BR>Was born and nurs'd in Ocean's pearly 
caves;<BR>First forms minute, unseen by spheric glass,<BR>Move on the mud, or 
pierce the watery mass;<BR>These, as successive generations bloom,<BR>New powers 
acquire, and larger limbs assume;<BR>Whence countless groups of vegetation 
spring,<BR>And breathing realms of fin, and feet, and wing.<BR></I><BR>and later 
on he writes:<I><BR>Cold gills aquatic form respiring lungs,<BR>And sounds 
aerial flow from slimy tongues.<BR></I>(click <A 
href="http://www3.mistral.co.uk/bradburyac/dar1.html"><B>here</B></A> for an 
interesting article about the real origins of the theory of 
evolution</A>)<BR><BR>His great grandson, Sir George Darwin is credited with the 
"fission hypothesis" theory that the moon was originally part of the earth, but 
Erasmus seems to have got their first:<BR><BR><I>Gnomes! how you shriek'd! when 
through the troubled air<BR>Roar'd the fierce din of elemental war;<BR>When rose 
the continents, and sunk the main,<BR>And Earth's huge sphere exploding burst in 
twain.-<BR>Gnomes! how you gazed! when from her wounded side<BR>Where now the 
South-Sea heaves its waste of tide,<BR>Rose on swift wheels the Moon's refulgent 
car,<BR>Circling the solar orb, a sister star,<BR>Dimpled with vales, with 
shining hills emboss'd,<BR>And roll'd round Earth her airless realms of 
frost.<BR><BR></I>NASA have found some evidence for the fission hypothesis 
recently, and so the theory has been revived (sadly minus the gnomes). See the 
links below for more on this. Bear in mind that there is evidence that current 
theories about the moon's composition are completely wrong (click <A

<H2>The Birmingham Lunar Society</H2><BR><BR>In the 1770's, Erasmus Darwin 
helped to found The Birmingham Lunar Society, a social club for the great 
scientists and industrialists of the day. The society met at full moon, 
supposedly so that they could find their way home afterwards. Members of the 
society included:<BR>Joseph Priestley (the discoverer of oxygen), Samuel Galton 
(a wealthy industrialist and quaker), William Small, The eccentrics Thomas Day 
and Richard Edgeworth, <A 
href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/SCboulton.htm"><B>Matthew 
Boulton</A></B> ("the creator of Birmingham"), <A 
href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/SCwatt.htm"><B>James Watt</B></A>, <A 
href="http://www2.exnet.com/magsample/science.html"><B>William 
Withering</B></A>, James Keir and Josiah Wedgewood. <BR><A name=1>Other people 
linked to the society included: Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, <A 
href="tlp.html#baron">Rudolph Erich Raspe</A> 
and William Murdoch<A 
href="#*">*</A> <BR>The Lunar 
Society has been described as the think tank of the industrial revolution. They 
are also often claimed to have been a masonic organisation, but I don't have any 
evidence for this. A medal struck to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the 
society's founding, features a single <A

"observare". <A
