<h2>Casual observations and unsubstantiated folklore</h2>

The Miskito Indians of Eastern Nicaragua, believe that all animals 

respond to the tide, that the woodpecker pecks when the tide is changing, 

and that hunting and fishing is best at the rising tide but not at 

new moon. They also believe that <a href="Lunar_gardening.html">

crops should be planted and harvested at certain phases of the moon</a>.<br><br>

 In a similar way, South sea islanders believe that whale sharks are most 

easily 

caught a few days after full 

moon. <a href="Bibliography2.html#animal">[5]</a><br><br>

Another belief is that castrating and weaning of 

animals should be done at certain phases of the moon, or when 

the moon is 

in a certain sign of the zodiac. See the links below for more on this.

<h2>The scientific evidence</h2>


<h3>Tidal rhythms</h3></a>



Numerous scientific papers have been written on tidal rhythms in 

marine animals. <a href="crab.html">Crabs</a> and other crustaceans 

seem to 

feature in these studies 

quite a lot, probably because they are affected by the tides

<a href="Bibliography2.html#animal">[2][3][10][11]</a>.<br><br>



In these cases, the animals seem to be following two rhythms: a daily 

(24 hour) rhythm, and a tidal (24.8 hour) rhythm<a href="#*">*</a>. 

These rhythms persisted in the laboratory under conditions of constant 

light and temperature.<br><br>



In many crustaceans, renewal of shells, sexual activity, and regeneration

 of lost limbs all follow lunar tidal rhythms (Nouvel, H. (1945)<i>

Bull. Inst. Oceanogr. Monaco</i>, <b>42</b> 878; 

Wheeler, J.F.G.<i>J.Linn.Soc.Zool.</i>, <b>40</b> 325). 

Activity of crabs has been measured, usually by placing the crabs in a 

tray, balanced on a knife edge, and connected to a rotating drum to 

record any movements which the crabs make. <br>

Fiddler crabs often became more active at the times when their burrows 

would have been uncovered by the tide.

<a href="Bibliography2.html#animal">[10]</a>.<br><br>

Activity of the shore crab <i>Carcinus maemas L.</i> follows a lunar 

tidal rhythm (Naylor, E., Atkinson, R.J.A. and Williams, B.G. <i>

J.Interdiscipl.Cycle Res.</i> <b>2</b> 2: 173-180), as does 

the crab <i>Sesarma</i> <a href="Bibliography2.html#animal">[3]</a>.

 Oxygen consumption in the Fiddler crab, <i>Uca pugnax</i> follows 

a daily rhythm and a tidal rhythm.

(<a href="Bibliography2.html#animal">[2]</a> ;

Webb, H.M. (1971) <i>J.Interdiscipl.Cycle Res. </i><b>2</b> 191-198). 



<br><br>



Tidal rhythms of activity have also been observed in fish, such as 

<i>Blennius pholis</i> <a href="Bibliography2.html#animal">[9]</a>; amphipods 

<a href="Bibliography2.html#animal">[12]</a>; Mussels 

(Rao, K.P. (1954) <i>Biological Bulletin</i> <b>106</b> 357-9); 

algae <a href="Bibliography2.html#animal">[8]</a><br><br>



In these examples, the animals may be responding to moonlight, gravity 

effects and possibly changes in temperature. In some cases the rhythm 

persists 

when they are kept in the laboratory under constant light and temperature, 

in other cases this is not so. Tidal rhythms may be modified daily rhythms, 

as in some cases the animals switch from a 24.8 hour tidal rhythm, to a 

24 hour rhythm in the lab.<br><br>

A study by Korringa (<i>Vakblad Biol.</i> Sept. 1947 129-137) apparently 

showed that oysters could respond to changes in the force of gravity associated with the 

tides. I vaguely remember reading about something like 

this in <i>Supernature</i> 

by Lyall Watson. Oysters were moved miles inland to Iowa or somewhere,

 and they 

began opening and closing their shells at the time that the tides would 

rise and fall, if there were tides in Iowa. I also read a sceptical article suggesting that this was 

simply due to a change to the circadian cycle, that often happens when 

animals are taken out of their natural environment<br><br>



Fiddler crabs also change colour daily, becoming lighter at night and darker 

in the day. On top of this 24 hour rhythm is a 12.4 hour tidal rhythm, 

which relates to the time at which their burrows are uncovered by the tide. 

The two rhythms coincide every 14.8 days, producing a noticable 

semi-monthly colour change. This could be relevant to the next section:<br>





<h3>Monthly rhythms</h3>



The phase of the moon seems to influence the behaviour of a number of 

animals. In many cases, the animals are simply responding to the changes in 

light, which may (for example) make them more visible to each other 

or to predators, but it is possible that there are monthly circadian 

rhythms in 

operation (as in humans), or that the animals are responding to gravitional 

effects. As in the case of <a href="Lunar_gardening.html">

The moon's effects on plants</a>, I am a bit sceptical of the latter 

hypothesis.<br><br>

 

The Palolo worm, <i>Eunice viridis</i> is found on several coral islands in 

the South Pacific, especially near to Samoa and the Fidji Islands. 

The palolos reproduce by swarming during the last quarter of the moon in October and November. 

The terminal parts of their bodies drop off and 

float over the surface of the water, releasing sperm and eggs.

This event is/was so important to the inhabitants of the Banks Islands, that 

it featured in their <a href="calendar.html#banks">Lunar Calendar</a>.<br>

A similar species is found in the Atlantic, but here swarming takes place 

in June or July during the first quarter of the moon.

<a href="Bibliography2.html#animal">[1]</a><br><br>







I have it on good authority 

that spiny lobsters in the red sea avoid foraging at full moon because of the 

threat from sharks.<br><br>



<i>Clunio marinus</i> has reproductive cycles synchronised with the phases 

of the moon (Caspars, H. (1951) <i>Arch.Hydrobiol</i> 416-594)<br><br>



The breeding behaviour of

 the Malayan Black Rice Bug seems to be synchronised with the phases of 

the moon. More young males rice bugs are caught in light traps at full 

moon than at any other time. Black rice bugs are serious pests of rice in 

the far-east <a href="Bibliography2.html#animal">[7]</a>. I 

suppose this may be similar to the behaviour of moths which fly into lights:

They navigate by the light of the full moon, so when they encounter 

other bright lights, they fly around them in circles. <br><br>



Gerbils in the Negev desert forage more for seeds at new moon than at 

full, because at full moon they are far more likely to be caught by owls 

<a href="Bibliography2.html#animal">[6]</a>. <br><br>



The moon seems to affect trout fishing. Between 1959

 and 1968, the largest catches of trout in lake Neuchatel in Switzerland

were just before or just after new moon, and the smallest catches 

were during full moon (Quartier, A.A.(1970) Influence de la lune sur la 

peche des truits du lac de Neuchatel. <i>Rapport de la Bibliotheques 

et des musees de la ville de neuchatel</i>).<br><br>

Horse breeders have claimed that mares are more likely to conceive at full moon, 
but so far research on this has been inconclusive. I own a female 
<a href="Set.html#donkeys">donkey</a> and you could set the calendar by her. 
When there was a male donkey in the area I learned to tie her up very securely on 
winter full moons! Strangely, she once went into heat in July during a 
solar eclipse. Winter is the usual donkey mating season.<br><br>

Research in Japan has shown that dairy cows are significantly more likely to be 
born at full moon. You can read the article here <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161735">

*12.4 hours is the time between two successive high or low tides. 

24.8 hours is a "lunar day".

Tides are greatest at new moon, when the gravitational pull of the sun and 

moon are both acting in the same direction. Because the moon is moving 

relative to the earth and the sun, the "lunar day" is not precisely 

24 hours.</a><br><br>
