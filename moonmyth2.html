<H1>The Mayan Moon Goddess</H1><BR>
<H3>by Dr. Mary E. Gutierrez, PhD</H3>
<P>
<P>According to Central Mexican (non-Mayan) traditions, the Moon and the Sun 
were created at the same time. Their creation took place at the central Mexican 
city of Teotihuacan at the dawn of the current cycle of cosmic creation. Two 
gods, Tecuciztecatl and Nanahuatzin threw themselves into the Fires of Creation 
and turned into two suns. But the gods who had assembled for this great event 
threw a <A 
href="toad_and_hare.html#hare">rabbit</A> into 
the face of Tecuciztecatl, thus dimming his brilliance so he became the 
Moon.<BR><BR>According to the Maya creation story, the POPOL VUH, once the Hero 
Twins Hunahpu and Xbalanque finished with their defeat of the Lords of Death and 
resurrected their father Hun-Hunahpu the Maize God in the ballcourt of Xibalba, 
they ascended to the heavens. In one version of the POPOL VUH one twin became 
the Sun and the other Venus, and in another, one became the Sun and the other 
the Moon.<BR><BR>Therefore, for the pre-Columbians of Central America the Moon 
was created through a process of transformation in which either divine or 
semi-divine beings through their own choice sacrificed themselves to become this 
heavenly body.<BR><BR>In addition to their famous solar calendar, the Maya also 
used a lunar calendar. It complemented the solar data given in inscriptions and 
is called the Lunar Series, or the Supplementary Series in older writings. 
Within the Lunar Series the Maya used a number of hieroglyphics, the majority of 
yet are still undeciphered as to their exact meanings. This series of usually 
six hieroglyphics denoted the length of the current lunar cycle and the age of 
the current moon, meaning what stage it was at during the lunar cycle according 
to the solar date of the inscription. The length of this Lunar "month" was 
approximately 29 days and measured the days between the appearance of two moons.

Moon Goddess. In Classic Period art (400 B. C. - A. D. 900) she is depicted as a 
young beautiful woman. During the Classic Period, as far as scholars can 
determine, her name was not mentioned in conjunction with her depictions. All we 
know is that she was a beautiful maiden, which brings to mind the Maiden aspect 
of the Goddess so prevellant throughout Europe as well as other parts of the 
world. One of the most famous depictions of the Mayan Moon Goddess has her 
sitting within a crescent moon with a foot dangling over the edge. She is seen 
in profile and holds a rabbit in her arms. Along with many Native Americans, the 
Maya say the <A 
href="toad_and_hare.html">profile of this 
rabbit</A> can be seen on the surface of the Full Moon. The rabbit she holds 
recalls the rabbit used by the gods at Teotihuacan to dim the face of 
Tecuciztecatl who became the Moon. <BR><BR>The Moon Goddess played an important 
part in Classic Period hieroglyphic inscriptions. Her head was used to denote 
the numeral one and also as a prefix to the names of Maya noble women, which 
served to differentiate their names from those of male Maya nobles. The Mayan 
Moon Goddess is believed by many modern-day Maya to be a feisty woman. It is 
believed that in the distant past she often quarreled with her husband, the Sun, 
who became so angry with his wife that he poked out one of her <A 
href="wadjet.html">eyes</A>, that is why she 
is dimmer than her celestial spouse to this day. There are Classic Period 
depictions of the Moon Goddess that may indicate that in addition to being 
feisty and hard to handle, she was also promiscuous. On a number of painted 
vessels she is depicted with various males who hug her or overtly fondle her 
breasts, something I am sure displeased Father Sun. Other times she is even seen 
in the company of man-sized rabbits.<BR><BR>The Mayan Moon Goddess was seen as 
the Goddess of childbirth, procreation, marriage, and had the power to bring 
about birth and rebirth. In this way, her vast powers mirror those of the Mother 
Goddess, Creatrix of the Universe. Nowadays, the Moon Goddess still holds a 
prominent position for the Maya, but she herself has gone through a type of 
transformation. With the advent of the Catholic Church, Mayan idols were 
smashed, their books were burned and their shamans and priests were tortured. 
Many went into hiding regarding their beliefs and kept small altars to the gods 
hidden in the surrounding forest, far from the eyes of the Europeans. However, 
one god had no reason to hide. The Moon Goddess as the beautiful young maiden 
who presided over childbirth and marriage was quickly identified with the Virgin 
Mary; and, as such, she has held her position of esteem in Mayan religion to 
this very day. <BR><BR>Dr. Gutierrez holds email classes on the mayan culture
