<h1>Sleeping Satellite by Tasmin Archer</h1>
<br><br>

I blame you for the moonlit sky<br>
and the dream that died<br>
with the eagles flight<br>
blame you for the moonlit nights<br>
when i wonder why<br>
are the seas still dry?<br>
don't blame this sleeping satellite<br>
did we squander the chance<br>
in the rush of the race<br>
the reason we chase is lost in romance<br>
and still we try<br>
to justify the waste<br>
for a taste of man's greatest adventure<br>
have we got what it takes to advance?<br>
did we peak too soon?<br>
if the world is so great<br>
then why does it scream under a blue moon<br>
we wonder why<br>
the earth's sacrificed<br>
for the price of it's greatest adventure<br>
and when we shoot for stars<br>
what a giant step<br>
have we got what it takes<br>
to carry the weight of this concept<br>
or pass it by like a shot in the dark<br>
miss the mark with a sense of adventure<br><br>
