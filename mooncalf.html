<h1>Mooncalves</h1>
<br>
Brewers dictionary of phrase and fable gives the following definition:<br>

Moon-calf is an inanimate, shapeless mass 
(Pliny; Natural History, x. 64). This abortion was supposed to be 
produced by the influence of the moon. The primary meaning of calf 
is not the young of a cow, but the issue arising from throwing out,
 as a push, a protuberance; hence the calves of the legs.<br>

A false conception, called mola, i.e. moon-calf . . . 
a lump of flesh without shape or life.- Holland: Pliny, vii. 16.<br><br>

The Oxford English Dictionary gives an alternative meaning:
 a deformed baby or congenital idiot<br><br>

In <i>The Tempest</i>, Caliban is called a mooncalf. If anyone knows more about this, please
