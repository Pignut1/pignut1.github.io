<h1>Is the moon made of green cheese?</h1>
<br>
<h3>(the scientific evidence)</h3>
<p>
<p>
 The landings of Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 on the moon sent shock waves through the 
moon's surface, which were detected on a seismograph. By measuring the speed of 
shock waves through rock (known as the seismic velocity),
the density of the rock can be estimated. The higher the 
seismic velocity, the denser the rock. Seismic velocities 
for moon "rock" were compared to those of rocks from various locations. 
The results were published in <i>Science</i>
 <a href="Bibliography.html#cheese">[1]</a>, 
and are shown below:<br><br>
<b>Seismic Velocities</b><br><br>
<b>Lunar________________Seismic Velocity (km/sec)</b><br>
Basalt 10017.....................1.84<br>
Basalt 10046.....................1.25<br>
Near surface layer..............1.2<br><br>
<b>Terrestrial rocks_______Seismic Velocity (km/sec)</b><br><br>
Granite...............................5.9<br>
Gneiss................................4.9<br>
Basalt.................................5.8<br>
Sandstone...........................4.9<br>
Marble................................6.02<br>
Limestone...........................5.06-5.97<br><br>
It is clear from this that moon "rock"
 is considerably less dense than any type of rock found on earth.
The scientists then decided to examine the seismic velocities of various cheeses
 from around the world. Some of the results are shown below:<br><br>
<b>Cheese_______________Seismic Velocity (km/sec)</b><br><br>
Sapsego (Swiss).................2.12<br>
Romano (Italy)....................1.74<br>
Cheddar (Vermont).............1.72<br>
Muenster (Wisconsin)..........1.57<br><br>
The seismic velocity of moon "rock" is much closer to cheese than any rock 
found on earth.
I admit that this is not conclusive proof that the moon is made of cheese,
 but
in the words of the scientists:<br>
<i>"Old hypotheses are best after all, and should not be lightly discarded"</i>
