<P>My wife saw a puzzling sight in October 1994, in the Mekong River near 
Nongkhai, Thailand, during a full moon, in the evening. Lights appeared under 
the water for a few hundred metres along the Mekong River. They rose from the 
bottom of the river and floated to the surface, then shot like missiles into the 
sky and out of sight. They were the size of beach balls, and many flew out of 
the water every few minutes, surfacing about 10 metres apart. I am told this 
happens every year at the same time. Locals say it is caused by a serpent 
releasing her eggs. Does anyone know of this phenomenon?<BR><BR><I>I read about 
the Mekong mystery with interest. In many respects it is similar to sightings of 
the ignis fatuus or will-o'-the-wisp which terrified English travellers in the 
Middle Ages and is found in the folklore of many different cultures. The ignis 
fatuus is a comparatively rare phenomenon which seems to result from the 
spontaneous combustion of marsh gases. For many years the active ingredient was 
thought to be a highly reduced compound of phosphorus--the hydride diphosphane 
which exerts a high vapour pressure at between 20 °C and -30 °C and 
spontaneously combusts in air at quite low concentrations. Earlier this century, 
scientists discounted the possibility that this compound could be formed by 
bacterial action, on thermodynamic grounds. But more recent work has shown that 
such reduced compounds do exist in decaying, phosphorus-rich organic matter. 
This can be seen in the so-called corpse candles reported in churchyards. 
<BR>Even so, further explanation is required in the Mekong case, because the 
light there was seen rising below the water. Gases forming in the presumably 
anoxic muds of the river would not come into contact with sufficient oxygen for 
underwater combustion, and the diphosphane hypothesis may have to be discounted. 
<BR>Some of the people who have experimented with these lights report seeing a 
"cold flame". There are several alternative theories to explain the phenomenon. 
For example, under low concentrations of oxygen, phosphorus vapour is 
luminescent and may easily form through diphosphane decomposition. Some 
microbiologists believe the phenomenon is caused by phosphorescent bacteria, a 
few species of which are thought to be soil-inhabiting. The dramatic exit of the 
gases as described by your correspondent is not without precedent and many 
remarkable descriptions are to be found in literature. I hold a record of 
European sightings and would welcome recent updates from readers. A British 
ignis fatuus distribution map is available to contributors.<BR></I>ALLAN 
PENTECOST<BR>Tunbridge Wells, Kent <BR><BR>Please send your records to Allan 
Pentecost c/o New Scientist: Mekong Mystery and we will forward the 
correspondence--Ed <BR><BR><I>The presence of the full Moon and the regular 
spacing of the lights would suggest to me an optical illusion. <BR>Regular 
standing waves on rivers are not uncommon and may occur after heavy seasonal 
rain, for example. While they often remain in one place, they can move up and 
downstream if the river is tidal. Their height and spacing depend on flow and 
river bed topography. <BR>The Moon, reflecting off these waves, can produce 
multiple reflections that might appear to move away from an observer, 
accelerating as the height of the wave decreases.<BR>Boat bow waves can also be 
very long-lasting (they have been implicated in sightings on Loch Ness) and 
could produce similar effects. <BR>TIM DOWNIE<BR>Ayr <BR><BR>[Archive: 20-27 
December 1997]<BR><BR>(continued) <BR>I have heard of the Mekong lights, though 
I have not actually seen them. I worked in this area as a geologist, and being 
intrigued by reports of the lights, inquired after the phenomenon from both 
local farmers and eyewitnesses. I can offer the following extra information. 
<BR>The lights not only occur in the part of the Mekong River that is referred 
to by your questioner but also in an adjacent area to the north, within Laos (in 
this area the Mekong River forms the national border between Laos and Thailand). 
<BR>They are confined only to this small area and I have not heard of their 
occurrence anywhere else in Laos or Thailand. They arise both from the river and 
from rice paddies, many of which are still flooded at that time of year. The 
Thai/Lao name for them is the Nekha Lights--the nekha is a large fish which 
lives in the local waters and is seen in great numbers on the river surface at 
certain times of the year. Perhaps this is the serpent to which the original 
questioner refers. The lights are a famous and ancient annual phenomenon in both 
countries, and one to which the local people attach an important religious 
significance. Many Lao and Thai people travel to the area to try to see them, 
although the lights vary in their intensity and in some years are barely 
visible, if at all. <BR>The lights have been filmed, and have also been shown on 
Thai television. The most intriguing aspect is that they occur only once a year, 
during the full moon in October for a very limited period (possibly only one 
night). The duration of a display is about 30 minutes, and there was a 
particularly dramatic show in 1996. <BR><BR>PAUL<BR><br>

</i>The Fortean Times recently ran a story on the lights, claiming that they 
are fireworks. The whole thing is apparently a hoax intended to attract tourists.
I'll fill in more details when I find the article. I remain open minded<br>
