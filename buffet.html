Cameron's getting logical, <br> 
A Vulcan in disguise,<br> 
The mysteries of the night are <br> 
Putting sparkle in his eyes.<br> <br>  

He's looking for sound reasoning,<br>  
But the best that I can do, <br> 
Is this transcendental story, <br> 
That I'll pass along to you. <br> <br> 

Past the falls they call Victoria, <br> 
Down the river named the Nile, <br> 
Drifts a tiny little handmade boat, <br> 
It's shaped just like a smile. <br> <br> 

And steered by a magician,<br> 
With the knowledge that he needs,<br>  
To keep him on his destined course,<br>  
Past the crocodiles and reeds.<br><br>   

He's the Admiral of the ocean,<br>  
The Lone Eagle in the sky, <br> 
He gave me my first sextant,<br>  
And he taught me how to fly. <br> 

It's been quite a lengthy passage,<br>  
From the dawn of time till now,<br>  
He has weathered the infernal storms<br>  
In his trusty petite dow.<br> <br>  

He has soared about colossal waves,<br>  
Sailed the endless sea.<br>  
Sometimes he resembles you,<br>  
Sometimes he looks like me.<br> <br>  

I saw him through my telescope,<br>  
On a cloudless night in June,<br>  
As he rested between voyages<br>  
At his beach house on the moon.<br> <br>  

There are windows to the galaxies <br> 
And hallways to the past.<br>  
There are trapdoors to the future<br>  
And a splintered ancient mast.<br>  
There are relics from Apollo trips,<br>  
When the earthmen came to play,<br>  
And a hammock from a distant star,<br>  
Out in the Milky Way.<br> <br>  

He's the Admiral of the ocean<br>  
The Lone Eagle in the sky.<br>  
He game me my first sextant<br>  
And he taught me how to fly.<br><br>   

I saw him through my telescope<br>  
On a cloudless night in June <br> 
As he rested between voyages <br> 
At his beach house on the moon.<br>  

A stripped bass breaks the surface<br>  
As the sunset fades away <br> 
And our journey from the Sea of Storms <br> 
Takes us home beside the bay.<br>  
We go fishing in the ocean<br>  
We go traveling back in time <br> 
Like the song says 'teach your children'<br>  
To go fishing with their minds.<br> <br>  

Cameron's contemplationg<br>  
I'm not sure just what he thinks<br>  
"Is my dad some kind of lunatic<br>  
With his stories and high hi-jinks".<br>  
Then he says when I get old and gray <br> 
And feel like I'm marooned,<br>  
He will take me in his rocket ship<br>  
To that beach house on the moon.<br> <br>
