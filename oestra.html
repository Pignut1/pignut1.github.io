The Saxon idol of the moon (possibly Oestra), portrayed as a goddess wearing a hood representing the ears of a hare and holding a moon disk. From R.Verstigan, <i> A Restitution of Decayed 
Intelligence</i>, Antwerp, 1605, Ch.3 Cited in <a href="Bibliography2.html#toad_and_hare"<i>The Leaping Hare</i></a><br><br>

I don't like 3rd hand references, if anyone has access to a copy of <i>A Restitution of Decayed Intelligence</i>, 
and can tell me more about this picture please leave a message in the <a href="index.html">guestbook</a>. Does anyone know more about Oestra? Is the hood meant to represent the ears of a hare or a <a href="Set.html">Donkey</a><br>

update: according to cavalorn http://cavalorn.livejournal.com/502368.html this is actually intended to represent Mani, Anglo Saxon MALE deity of the moon.
