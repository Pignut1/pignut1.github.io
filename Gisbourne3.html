Me thought they did me beate and binde,<BR>
And took my bow mee froe;<BR>
If I be Robin a-live in this lande,<BR>
I'le be wrocken on both them towe."<BR>
.<BR>
"Sweavens are swift<A HREF="#*****">*****</A> master",quoth John,<BR>
"As the wind that blows ore a hill;<BR>
For if itt be never soe lowde this night,<BR>
To-morrow it may be still."<BR>
.<BR>
"Buske yee, bowne yee, my merry men all,<BR>
For John shall, goe with mee;<BR>
For I'le goe seeke yond wight yeomen<BR>
In greenwood where they bee."<BR>
.<BR>
The(y) cast on their gowne of greene,<BR>
a shooting gone are they,<BR>
Untill they came to the merry greenwood,<BR>
Where they had gladdest bee;<BR>
.<BR>
They were the ware of [a] wight yeoman,<BR>
His body leaned to a tree.<BR>
.<BR>
A sword and a dagger he wore by his side,<BR>
Had beene many a mans bane,<BR>
And he was clad in his capull-hyde,<A HREF="#******">******</A><BR>
Topp, and tayle and mayne.<BR>
.<BR>
"Stand you still, master,"quoth Litle John,<BR>
"Under this trusty tree,<BR>
And I will goe to yond wight yeoman,<BR>
To know his meaning trulye"<BR>
.<BR>
"A, John, by me thou sets noe store,<BR>
And thats a Farley thinge;<BR>
How offt send I my men beforre<BR>
And tarry my-selfe behinde?<BR>
.<BR>
"It is noe cunning a knave to ken, <BR>
And a man but heare him speake;<BR>
And itt were not for bursting of my bowe,<BR>
John, I wold thy head breake"<BR>
.<BR>
But often words they breeden bale,<BR>
That parted Robin and John;<BR>
John is gone to Barnesdale,<BR>
The gates he knows eche one.<BR>
.<BR>
And when hee came to Barnesdale,<BR>
Great heavinesse there hee hadd;<BR>
He found two of his fellowes<BR>
were slaine both in a slade,<BR>
.<BR>
And Scarlett a foote flyinge was,<BR>
Over stockes and stone,<BR>
For the sheriffe with seven score men<BR>
Fast after him is gone.<BR>
.<BR>
"Yett one shot, I'le shoote, says Litle John,<BR>
"With Crist his might and mayne;<BR>
I'le make yon fellow that flyes soe fast<BR>
To be both glad and faine."<BR>
.<BR>
John bent up a good yiewe bow<BR>
And fettled him to shoote;<BR>
The bow was made of a tender boughe,<BR>
And fell downe to his foote.<BR>
.<BR>
"Woe worth thee wicked wood",sayd Litle John,<BR>
That ere thou grew on a tree!<BR>
For this day thou art my bale,<BR>
My boote when thou shold bee!"<BR>
.<BR>
This shoote it was but looselye shot,<BR>
The arrowe flew in vaine,<BR>
And it hit one of the sheriffes men;<BR>
Good William a Trent was slaine.<BR>
.<BR>
It had beene better for William a Trent<BR>
To hange upon a gallowe<BR>
Then for to lye in the greenwoode,<BR>
There slaine with an arrowe.<BR>
.<BR>
And it is sayd when men be mett,<BR>
Six can doe more than three:<BR>
And they have tane Litle John,<BR>
And bound him fast to a tree.<BR>
.<BR>
"Thou shalt be drawen by dale and downe," quote the sheriffe,<BR>
"And hanged hye on a hill:"<BR>
"But thou may fayle,"quoth Litle John,<BR>
"If itt be Christs owne will."<BR>
.<BR>
Let us leave talking of Litle John,<BR>
For hee is bound fast to a tree,<BR>
And talke of Guy and Robin Hood,<BR>
In the green woode where they bee.<BR>
.<BR>
How these two yeomen together they mett,<BR>
Under the leaves of lyne,<BR>
To see what merchandise they made<BR>
Even at that same time.<BR>
.<BR>
"Good morrow, good fellow," quoth Sir Guy:<BR>
"Good morrow, good fellow,"quoth hee;<BR>
"Me thinkes by this bow thou beares in thy hand,<BR>
A good archer thou seems to bee."<BR>
.<BR>
"I am wilful of my way,"quoth Sir Guye,<BR>
"And of my morning tyde:"<BR>
"I'le lead thee through the wood,"quoth Robin,<BR>
"Good fellow, I'le be thy guide."<BR>
.<BR>
I seeke an outlaw,"quoth Sir Guye,<BR>
"Men call him Robin Hood;<BR>
I had rather meet with him upon a day<BR>
Than forty pound of golde."<BR>
.<BR>
"If you tow mett it wold be seene whether were better<BR>
Afore yee did part awaye;<BR>
Let us some other pastime find,<BR>
Good fellow,I thee pray.<BR>
.<BR>
"Let us some other masteryes make,<BR>
And wee will walk in the woods even;<BR>
Wee may chance meet with Robin Hoode<BR>
At some unsett steven."<BR>
.<BR>
They cut them down the summer shroggs<BR>
Which grew both under a bryar,<BR>
And sett them three score rood in twinn,<BR>
To shoot the prickes full neare.<BR>
.<BR>
"Leade on good fellow," sayd Sir Guye,<BR>
"Lead on, I doe bidd thee:"<BR>
"Nay by my faith,"quoth Robin Hood,<BR>
The leader thou shalt bee."<BR>
.<BR>
The first good shoot that Robin ledd<BR>
Did not shoot an inch the pricke froe;<BR>
Guy was an archer good enoughe,<BR>
But he cold never shoote soe.<BR>
.<BR>
The seconde shoote Sir Guy shott,<BR>
He shott within the garlande;<BR>
But Robin Hoode shott itt better than hee, <BR>
For he clove the good pricke-wande,<BR>
.<BR>
"Gods blessing on thy heart!" sayes Guye,<BR>
"Goode fellow, thy shooting is goode;<BR>
For an thy hart be as good as thy hands, <BR>
Thou were better than Robin Hood<BR>
.<BR>
"Tell me thy name, good fellow,"quoth Guy,<BR>
Under the leaves of lyne:"<BR>
"Nay, by my faith,"quoth good Robin,<BR>
"Till thou have told me thine."<BR>
.<BR>
"I dwell by dale and downe," quoth Guye,<BR>
"And I have done many a curst turne;<BR>
And he that calls me by my right name<BR>
Calls me Guy of good Gysbourne."<BR>
.<BR>
"My dwelling is in the wood,"sayes Robin;<BR>
"By thee I set right nought;<BR>
My name is Robin Hood of Barnesdale,<BR>
A fellow thou has long sought."<BR>
.<BR>
He that had neither beene a kithe nor kin<BR>
Might have seen a full fayre sight,<BR>
To see how together these yeomen went, <BR>
With blades both browne and bright<BR>
.<BR>
To have seene how these yeomen together fought,<BR>
Two howers of a summers day;<BR>
Itt was neither Guy nor Robin Hood<BR>
That fettled them to flye away.<BR>
.<BR>
Robin was reacheles on a roote,<BR>
And stumbled at that tyde,<BR>
And Guy was quicke and nimble withall,<BR>
And hitt him ore the left side.<BR>
.<BR>
"Ah, deere Lady!" sayd Robin Hoode,<BR>
"Thou art both mother and may!<BR>
I thinke it was never mans destinye<BR>
To dye before his day."<BR>
.<BR>
Robin thought on Our Lady deere,<BR>
And soone leapt up againe,<BR>
And thus he came with an awkwarde<A HREF="#*******">*******</A> stroke;<BR>
Good Sir Guy hee has slayne.<BR>
.<BR>
He tooke Sir Guys head by the hayre,<BR>
And sticked itt on his bowes end:<BR>
"Thou hast beene traytor all thy liffe,<BR>
Which thing must have an ende."<BR>
.<BR>
Robin pulled forth an Irish kniffe,<BR>
And nicked Sir Guy in the face,<BR>
That he was never on a woman borne<BR>
Cold tell who Sir Guy was.<BR>
.<BR>
Saies, "Lye there, lye there, good Sir Guye,<BR>
And with me be not wrothe;<BR>
If thou have had the worse strokes at my hand,<BR>
Thou shalt have the better cloathe."<BR>
.<BR>
Robin did off his gowne of greene,<BR>
Sir Guye he did it throwe;<BR>
And he put on that capull-hyde,<BR>
That clad him toppe to toe.<BR>
.<BR>
"The bowe, the arrowes, and litle horne,<BR>
And with me now I'll beare;<BR>
For now I go to Barnesdale,<BR>
To see how my men do fare."<BR>
.<BR>
Robin sett Guyes horne to his mouth,<BR>
A lowd blast in it he did blow;<BR>
That beheard the sheriffe of Nottingham,<BR>
As he leaed under a lowe.<BR>
.<BR>
"Hearken! hearken! sayd the sheriffe<BR>
"I heard noe tydings but good;<BR>
For yonder I heare Sir Guyes horne blow,<BR>
For he hath slaine Robin Hoode.<BR>
.<BR>
"For yonder I heare Sir Guyes horne blow,<BR>
Itt blowes soe well in tyde,<BR>
For yonder comes that wighty yeoman,<BR>
Cladd in his capull-hyde.<BR>
.<BR>
Come hither, thou good Sir Guye,<BR>
Aske of me what thou wilt have:"<BR>
"I'le none of thy gold sayes Robin Hood,<BR>
Nor I'll none of it have.<BR>
.<BR>
But now I have slaine the master," he sayd,<BR>
"Let me goe strike the knave;<BR>
This is all the reward I aske,<BR>
Nor noe other will I have."<BR>
.<BR>
"Thou art a madman,"said the shiriffe,<BR>
"Thou sholdest have had a knights fee;<BR>
Seeing thy asking [hath] been soe badd,<BR>
Well granted it shall be."<BR>
.<BR>
But Litle John heard his master speake,<BR>
Well he knew that was his steven;<BR>
Now shall I be loset," quoth litle John,<BR>
With Christs might in heaven"<BR>
.<BR>
But Robin hee hyed him towards Litle John,<BR>
Hee thought hee wold loose him believe;<BR>
The sheriffe and all his companye<BR>
fast after him did drive.<BR>
.<BR>
"Stand abacke! strand abacke!" sayd Robin;<BR>
"Why draw you mee soe neere?<BR>
Itt was never the use in our countrye<BR>
One's shrift another shoul heere.<BR>
.<BR>
But Robin pulled forth an Iryshe kniffe,<BR>
And losed John hand and foote,<BR>
And gave him Sir Guyes bow in his hand,<BR>
And bade it be his boote<BR>
.<BR>
But John tooke Sir Guyes bow in his hand-<BR>
His arrowes were rawstye buy the roote-,<BR>
The sheriffe saw Litle John draw a bow<BR>
And fettle him to shoote.<BR>
.<BR>
Towards his house in Nottingham<BR>
He fled full fast away,<BR>
And so did all his companye,<BR>
Not one behind did stay.<BR>
.<BR>
But he could neither soe fast goe,<BR>
Noraway soe fast runn,<BR>
But Litle John, with an arrow broade,<BR>
Did cleave his heart in twinn.<BR>

*As far as I can see, there is only one scene in <I>"Robin Hood Prince of thieves"</I> which is derived from the traditional legends of Robin Hood, and that is the scene in which Robin and Little John fight with quarter staffs over the river. Most of the rest of the film is inspired by previous Hollywood films, the BBC series <I>"Robin of Sherwood"</I> (in my opinion, the best portrayal of Robin Hood on screen ever), and <I>Ivanhoe</I> by Sir Walter Scott. I may be wrong about this, but I don't think that Robin Hood was ever linked to Richard I and the crusades, before <I>Ivanhoe</I>. Likewise, the idea of Robin as an aristocrat who has lost his land, also originated fairly late in the development of the legend. I'm not a huge fan of this film[<A HREF="#1">back</A>]<BR>
<BR>
**woodweele = green woodpecker <A HREF="Bibliography.html#gisbourne">[3] </A>- Lincoln green plumage and a red crest. The university of Rochester page (link below) translates "Woodweele" as Golden Oriole (a summer migrant)[<A HREF="#2">back</A>]<BR>
<BR>
***Lyne = Linden or Lime, this tree is traditionally associated with midsummer <A HREF="Bibliography.html#gisbourne">[2]</A>. The mother of Cheiron the centaur (half man, half horse) was called Philyra, which means "lime tree". She was apparently transformed into a lime tree by Zeus. In upland areas, the "tree" of midsummer was <A HREF="heather.html">heather </A>(ling?)[<A HREF="#3">back</A>]<BR>
<BR>
****wight = strong, fast, courageous, skilled in arms, vigourous. Also applied (as a noun) to supernatural or unearthly beings. <A HREF="Bibliography.html#gisbourne">[3]</A>[<A HREF="#4">back</A>]<BR>
<BR>
*****John seems to be saying that dreams are fleeting and should not be taken too seriously. Presumably, in the missing section of the ballad, Robin talks about a disturbing dream which he has had. Perhaps, like <A HREF="sculpture.html">The Sorrowful God</A>, Robin knows what awaits him[<A HREF="#5">back</A>]<BR>

On the summer solstice, the horse-headed man, with rusted sword and arrows, representing the waning of the year, beheads the green man who represents the waxing year. According to the theory of Sir James Frazer and Robert Graves, this is a distant memory of an actual practice of human sacrifice. At some point in prehistory, the green man (a sort of vegetation/fertility god, and figurehead to his people) refused to be sacrificed, and cheated death by changing places with the horse headed man, and assuming his identity (In much the same way, Aztec priests used to wear the flayed skins of the sacrificial victims; Athene flayed Pallas and assumed his identity and Apollo flayed the satyr, Marsyas). This required the consent of the Lady "who is both Mother and May", and a change of costume. Robin Hood does not always wear Lincoln Green, In one story, Robin is described as leading his men into Nottingham, in June dressed in red. As Robert Graves notes, in June, stags change into their summer coats. The name "Robin" may be related to the latin "robus" meaning red. Robin Hood is also often nicknamed "Brown Robin"<BR>
<BR>
This story has some similarities to "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight", and also to the story of <A HREF="Set.html#samson">Samson</A>, as Samson is compared to a lion (waxing year), but is later treated as an ass (waning year).<BR>
Readers of "The Golden Bough", might be interested to know that in France, gue or gui means mistletoe.<A HREF="Bibliography.html#gisbourne">[1]</A> On the island of Sein in Brittany, there is (or was, I don't know, if you know, Please <A HREF="mailto:pignut@altavista.net">E-Mail me</A>) an annual mistletoe feast, involving a procession of musicians, and children carrying bill-hooks and oak branches, and leading an ox and a horse covered with flowers. After them follows a crowd, which stops at intervals, crying "Gui-na-ne, voila le Gui"<A HREF="Bibliography.html#gisbourne">[1]</A>. The name Guy may be related to various words meaning "horse" , and also to words for "mind", "reason" and "spirit"<BR>
<BR>
Ronald Hutton, in his book <I>The Stations of the Sun</I> records that in the area where Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire meet (i.e. the same area that most of the Robin Hood stories are set in), there was a tradition in the last century of parading an "old horse" made of wood and old sheets, operated by a man inside of it, at Christmas, and singing a popular song, "poor old horse". While they were singing, a blacksmith would try unsuccessfully to shoe the horse, while the horse strenuously resisted, to the amusement of the audience<A HREF="Bibliography.html#gisbourne">[4]. </A><I>"The Stations of the Sun"</I> is a comprehensive guide to the traditional festivals of the British isles, which explores many different interpretations and academic controversies. It is generally sceptical of the ideas of Frazer, and the idea of pagan influence upon traditional festivals. If you think I'm writing nonsense, this is the book for you!<BR>
<BR>
"Hobby horses", like the one described above used to be quite common in English festivals. The New English Dictionary has the following entry:<BR>
<I>"Hobby, Hobyn, Robin, Robbie, a small or medium sized horse"</I> <BR>
The words "hob" (as in <A HREF="elf.html">"hobgoblin"</A>) and robin are related. In many festivities, the hobby horse appeared alongside someone dressed as Robin Hood. It has apparently been suggested that the hobby horse represents Robin Hood himself (Richard Wolfram <I>"Robin Hood und hobby-horse"</I> [festchr fur R.Much] Wiener Prahist, Zeitschr XIX 1932 257-74) <A HREF="Bibliography.html#gisbourne">[5]</A>. <BR>
<BR>
No one seems exactly sure where Guy of Gisbourne came from. There is apparently a "Gisbourne" in Lancashire, although this seems a bit far afield. Guisborough, on the south slopes of the North York Moors has also been suggested. Perhaps Robin's rival was originally "Guy the Guiser", meaning someone who wears a mask? An ancient image of a figure wearing a horse head mask was found in pinhole cave, Derbyshire.<BR>
<BR>
There is a much better known story, (part of "A Gest of Robyn Hode") in which the Sheriff of Nottingham organises an archery contest, in order to capture Robin. It bears a number of similarities to this story:<BR>
For example, in both stories, Robin conceals his identity, only to reveal himself by his skill at archery. The latter story ends with Robin beheading the sheriff.<BR>
