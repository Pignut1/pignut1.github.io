This page should not be confused with the one about <a href="godwin.html">"The Man in the Moone"</a>, 
which is a story about space travel in the early 17th century.<br><br>
The first thing I ought to say is that many people (myself included) see a face 
when they look at the full moon. Others see a face in profile when they look at 
the crescent moon (usually the waxing moon). This is NOT what is meant by 
"The man in the moon". To see the Man in the moon, click <a href="see_man.html">Here</a>.

<h2>European Legends</h2><br>The man in the moon is usually seen as an old man carrying a bundle of sticks upon his back, 
sometimes carrying a forked stick and lantern and accompanied by a little dog.<br> 
In "A Midsummer Night's dream", during the rustics performance of "Pyramus and Thisbe", the actor representing moonshine 
is dressed in just this way. The man in the moon is also mentioned in <i>The Tempest:
<br><br>CALIBAN: Hast though not dropped from heaven?<br>
STEPHANO: Out of the moon I do assure thee: I was the man i' the moon when time was<br>
CALIBAN: I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee: My mistress 
showed me thee and thy dog and thy bush</i><br><br>(Caliban is repeatedly called a 
<a href="mooncalf.html">Moon calf</a> in this scene).<br>There are many European legends explaining how the man in the 
moon got there, the most popular says that he was banished there by Moses, for gathering firewood upon the sabbath. <br><br>
 <i>"And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. 
And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation. And they put him
 in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him. And the lord said unto Moses, The man shall surely be 
put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp. And all the congregation brought him 
without the camp, and stoned him with stones till he died." </i>(Numbers XV. 32-36)<br><br>


The belief that the man was banished to the moon persisted throughout the middle ages. This also explains the reference 
to Moses in the R.E.M song "Man on the moon" (or is this something to do with Andy Kaufmann? 
Leave a message in the <a href="index.html">guestbook</a> if you know)<br><br> A German version of the story goes something like this:<br><br> <i>"Ages ago there went one Sunday morning an old man into the wood to hew sticks. He cut a faggot and slung it on a stout staff, cast it over his shoulder, and began to trudge home with his burden. On his way, he met a handsome man in Sunday suit, walking towards the church.<br> " Don't you know that it is Sunday, when all good Christians should be resting from their labours?" said the stranger<br> "Sunday on earth, or Monday in heaven, it's all the same to me!" laughed the old man <br>" Then bear your bundle forever, and as you value not Sunday on earth yours shall be a perpetual moon day in heaven; and you shall stand for eternity in the moon, a warning to all sabbath-breakers"</i><a href="Bibliography2.html#Man_in_moon">[1]</a><br><br> and the stranger banished him to the moon.<br>
<a name="1"><a name="2"><a href="Bibliography2.html#Man_in_moon">[1]</a>. 
(<a href="http://mypage.bluewin.ch/chregesteffen"><b>Rockhound</b></a>who is from Switzerland, wrote to 
tell me that her Grandmother used to tell a similar story. Thanks Rockhound!)<br><br>In his book 
<i>"Curious myths of the middle ages"</i> Sabine Baring-Gould reproduces other versions of this story, and finds 
references to the figure in the moon, from ancient Rome and Egypt. In one version of the story, the man is carrying 
willow bows<a href="#*">*</a> . In another he is a sheep stealer who entices sheep with 
<a href="cabbage.html">cabbages</a><br><br> The man is formed from the <a href="Moon_diagram.html">
Mare Serenitatis, tranquilitatis and foecunditatis</a>. The dog is the <a href="Moon_diagram.html">Mare Crisium</a>. 
According to one interpretation, The forked stick which he carries is a ray from the crater <a href="Moon_diagram.html">
"Tycho"</a> (click <a href="see_man.html">here </a>to see the Man in the Moon).<br><br>Baring-Gould also shows how the 
nursery rhyme of Jack and Jill is derived from a Norse legend, in which the moon kidnaps two children named Hjuki and Bil, 
and makes them fetch water from a well (Mimirs well?....possibly. Click <a href=
"wadjet.html#legend"> here </a> to find out what I'm on about). According to this theory, the figure in the moon is 
Jack (Hjuki). Jill (Bil) is less easy to see. The names "Hjuki" and "Bil" mean "creation" and "destruction", 
i.e. waxing and waning <a href="Bibliography2.html#Man_in_moon">[1]</a>.<br><br>
I recently stumbled on the story of <b><A href="http://www.mundilfari.org/mani-mead.htm">Mead on the moon</a></b> 
on a site devoted to a cult of the Norse moon god Mani. The story combines elements of the Hjuki and Bil, with 
folklore about mead which I have discussed on the <a href="Moonshine.html">moonshine</a> page. It is said to be a 
Norse tale. It seems a little too good to be true, and I can't vouch for it's authenticity, but certainly worth reading 
as it is the work of a skillfull storyteller, regardless of when it was written.<br><br>
Whenever Salvador Dali painted the moon, he always emphasized the man in the moon (e.g. <i>"sleep"</i> and
 <i>"Swans reflecting elephants"</i>)<a href="#top">[top]</a><br><br><a name="inuit"><h2>Inuit Legends</h2><br>
The man in the moon features in the beliefs of the Inuits (Eskimos to the 
politically incorrect). In Alaska, it is believed that the man in the moon is 
the keeper of the souls of men and animals. Shamans claim to have the power to 
ascend to the moon and converse with him <a href="Bibliography2.html#Man_in_moon">[2]</a>
For more on the journey to the moon, click <a href="Stairway.html"> here </a><a href="#top">[top]</a>.
The Haida people of the Pacific west coast of Canada and Alaska have a legend that a boy gathering firewood by moonlight was banished to the moon for insulting the moon.<a href="bibliography2.html#Man_in_moon">[10]</a>
<a name="fareast"><br><br><h2>Far Eastern Legends</h2><br>
In Malasia, the man in the moon is an old hunchback sitting beneath an inverted banyan tree. He is plaiting bark into 
a fishing line to catch everything on earth. (This seems to have something in common with the legends of the 
<a href="Stairway.html"> Stairway to heaven </a>). There is also a rat which gnaws through the fishing line and 
a cat which chases the rat. So long as this equilibrium continues, the world is safe, but if the hunchback ever 
completes his fishing line, the world will end. <a href="Bibliography.html#Man_in_moon">[4]</a>.<br><br>
In China, the man in the moon is called Wu Kang (Gekkawo in Japan)
, the god of love and marriage, who unites lovers by tying their feet together with invisible cords. 
Wu Kang also cuts branches from the Cassia tree of immortality, which grows in the moon.<br><br><a name="melanesia">
<h2>Melanesian Legends</h2>
On Florida Island in the Solomon Islands, the man in the moon is called 
Ngava. At full moon people cry "There is Ngava sitting".
<a href="Bibliography.html#Man_in_moon">[9]</a><br><br>

Similar legends are widespread in Africa. The Tswana people of South Africa have a legend of a woman in the moon, banished there for gathering firewood, when she should have been at a sacred festival. See <a href="https://youtu.be/qcKS8SDcNRE">Multicultural Musings</a> for more on this<br><br>
In Hawaii people see a woman in the moon. They call her 
<a href= "moonmyth1.html#hina"> Hina-i-ka-maloma </a> 
(See link below for how to see her)<a href="#top">[top]</a><br><br>
<i>"Curious myths of the middle ages" </i> has recently been 
reprinted, and the chapter on "The man in the moon" has been extended. However 
I still feel that it is necessary to write this, because the new edition is 
ambiguous and appears to have been edited by someone who has not taken the 
trouble to have a good look at the moon. Perhaps I am merely being pernickity, 
about a subject close to my heart (the rest of the book is brilliant).<br>
The moon seems to be something of a Rorshack test, with different people
seeing different images, depending on their cultural background, but certain images seem to crop up in widely 
separated parts of the world, implying that these images are not totally arbitrary.<br><br>

Then I'll come back to you<br></i>
Anonymous (or possibly 
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Square/8074">
<b>Maggie Blue</b></a>'s aunt Barbara)<br><br>
<a name="nursery">Most people know about The man in the moon, from the nursery rhyme which runs:<br><br>
<i>"The man in the moon<br>
Came down too soon<br>
And asked his way to Norwich<br>
He went by the south<br>
And burned his mouth<br>
With supping cold pease porridge"</i><a href="Bibliography.html#Man_in_moon">[6]</a><br><br>
Another old nursery rhyme runs:<br><br>
<i>"The man in the moon was caught in a trap<br>
For stealing the thorns from another mans gap<br>
If he had gone by and let the thorns lie<br>
He'd never been man in the moon so high."
<br></i><a href="Bibliography2.html#Man_in_moon">[6]</a><br><br>
This rhyme makes reference to the rights of individuals to gather firewood from 
particular hedgerows, so it probably predates the enclosures act 
(late eighteenth century).<a href="#poems">[poems]</a><br><br>
<a name="bilbo">
In "The lord of the rings"</i>, 
Frodo recites a longer version of the rhyme, which
Tolkien describes as:<br><i>
"a ridiculous song that Bilbo had been rather fond of 
(and indeed rather proud of, for he had made up the words himself)
.....Only a few words of it are now, as a rule, remembered".<br></i>
It went like this:<br><br><i>
There is an inn a merry old inn<br>
beneath an old grey hill,<br>
And there they brew a beer so brown<br>
That the Man in the Moon himself came down<br>
one night to drink his fill<br><br>
The ostler has a tipsy cat<br>
that plays a five-stringed fiddle;<br>
And up and down he draws his bow,<br>
Now squeaking high, now purring low,<br>
now sawing in the middle.<br><br>
The landlord keeps a little dog<br>
that is mighty fond of jokes;<br>
When there's good cheer among the guests,<br>
He cocks an ear at all the jests and laughs until he chokes.<br><br>
They also keep a horn-ed cow<br>
as proud as any queen;<br>
But music turns her head like ale,<br>
And makes her wave her tufted tail<br>
and dance upon the green.<br><br>
And O! the rows of silver dishes<br>
and the store of silver spoons!<br>
For Sunday there's a special pair,<br>
And these they polish up with care<br>
on saturday afternoons.<br><br>
The Man in the Moon was drinking deep,<br>
and the cat began to wail;<br>
A dish and a spoon on the table danced,<br>
The cow in the garden madly pranced,<br>
and the little dog chased its tail.<br><br>
The Man in the Moon took another mug,<br>
and then rolled beneath his chair;<br>
And there he dozed and dreamed of ale,<br>
Till in the sky the stars were pale<br>
and dawn was in the air.<br><br>
Then the ostler said to his tipsy cat:<br>
"The white horses of the Moon,<br>
They neigh and champ their silver bits;<br>
But their master's been and drowned his wits,<br>
and the sun'll be rising soon!"<br><br>
So the cat on his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle,<br>
a jig that would wake the dead:<br>
He squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune,<br>
While the landlord shook the Man in the Moon<br>
"It's after three!" he said<br><br>
They rolled the man slowly up the hill<br>
and bundled him into the moon,<br>
While his horses galloped up in rear,<br>
And the cow came capering like a deer,<br>
and a dish ran up with the spoon.<br><br>
Now quicker the fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle;<br>
the dog began to roar,<br>
The cow and the horses stood on their heads;<br>
the guests all bounded from their beds<br>
and danced upon the floor<br><br>
With a ping and a pong the fiddle strings broke!<br>
the cow jumped over the moon,<br>
And the little dog laughed to see such fun,<br>
And the Saturday dish went off at a run<br>
With the silver Sunday spoon.<br><br>
The round Moon rolled behind the hill,<br>
as the sun raised up her head.<br>
She hardly believed her fiery eyes;<br>
For though it was day, to her surprise<br>
They all went back to bed!<br><br></i>
Tolkien notes that elves and hobbits consider the Sun to be feminine
I vaguely remember reading somewhere that this was a
private joke between Tolkien and Peter and Iona 
Opie (folklorists), who claim that the reference to "plum porridge" 
(another version says "pease porridge"), rather than plum pudding, meant that the poem predated the invention of 
cheesecloth<a href="Bibliography2.html#Man_in_moon">[6]</A>. If anyone knows more about

<a name="why">Here is another poem written by Tolkien about the man in the moon:<br><br>
<h3>Why the man in the moon came down too soon</h3><br><br><i>
The Man in the Moon had silver shoon<br>
And his beard was of silver thread;<br>
He was girt with pure gold and inaureoled<br>
With gold about his head.<br>
Clad in silken robe in his great white globe<br>
He opened an ivory door<br>
With a crystal key, and in secrecy<br>
He stole o'er a shadowy floor;<br><br>
Down a filigree stair of spidery hair<br>
He slipped in gleaming haste,<br>
And laughing with glee to be merry and free<br>
He swiftly earthward raced.<br>
He was tired of his pearls and diamond twirls;<br>
Of his pallid minaret<br>
Dizzy and white at its lunar height<br>
In a world of silver set;<br><br>
And adventured this peril for ruby and beryl<br>
And emerald and sapphire,<br>
And all lustrous gems for new diadems,<br>
Or to blazon his pale attire.<br>
He was lonely too with nothing to do<br>
But to stare at the golden world,<br>
Or to strain at the hum that would distantly come<br>
As it gaily past him whirled;<br><br>
And at plenilune in his argent moon<br>
He had wearily longed for Fire-<br>
Not the limpid lights of wan selenites,<br>
But a red terrestrial pyre<br>
With impurpurate glows of crimson and rose<br>
And leaping orange tongue;<br>
For great seas of blues and the passionate hues<br>
When a dancing dawn is young;<br><br>
For the meadowy ways like chrysophrase<br>
By winding Yare and Nen.<br>
How he longed for the mirth of the populous Earth<br>
And the sanguine blood of men;<br>
And coveted song and laughter long<br>
And viands hot and wine,<br>
Eating pearly cakes of light snowflakes<br>
And drinking thin <a href="Moonshine.html"> moonshine</a>.<br><br>
He twinkled his feet as he thought of the meat,<br>
Of the punch and the peppery brew,<br>
Till he tripped unaware on his slanting stair,<br>
And fell like meteors do;<br>
As the whickering sparks in splashing arcs<br>
Of stars blown down like rain<br>
From his laddery path took a foaming bath<br>
In the ocean of Almain;<br><br>
And began to think, lest he melt and stink,<br>
What in the moon to do,<br>
When a Yarmouth boat found him far afloat,<br>
To the mazement of the crew<br>
Caught in their net all shimmering wet<br>
In a phosphorescent sheen<br>
Of bluey whites and opal lights<br>
And delicate liquid green<br><br>
With the morning fish - 'twas his regal wish -<br>
They packed him to Norwich town,<br>
To get warm on gin in a Norfolk inn,<br>
And dry his watery gown.<br>
Though St. Peter's knell waked many a bell<br>
In the city's ringing towers<br>
To shout the news of his lunatic cruise<br>
In the early morning hours,<br><br>
No hearths were laid, not a breakfast made,<br>
And no one would sell him gems;<br>
He found ashes for fire, and his gay desire<br>
For choruses and brave anthems<br>
Met snores instead with all Norfolk abed,<br>
And his round heart nearly broke,<br>
More empty and cold than above of old,<br>
Till he bartered his fairy cloak<br><br>
With a half waked cook for a kitchen nook,<br>
And his belt of gold for a smile,<br>
And a priceless jewel for a bowl of gruel,<br>
A sample cold and vile<br>
Of the proud plum porridge of Anglian Norwich -<br>
He arrived much too soon<br>
For unusual guests on adventurous quests<br>
From the <a href="Stairway.html#mountain">Mountains of the Moon</a>.
</i><a href="Bibliography2.html#Man_in_moon">[7]</A><br><br>
Almain is an old name for England, and the Yare and Nen (or Nene) 
are rivers which flow into the North sea at Great Yarmouth. The poem 
reminds me of the legend of the beast of Orford (to the south of Yarmouth),
a sort of wild man with a long beard who was accidentally caught in 
fishing nets, and taken as a prisoner to the home of Ralph of Coggeshall 
who kept him as a pet. The creature was often tormented in an effort to 
make him speak (he never did). One day the creature broke out of its pen, 
through the barricades, escaped to the sea, and was never seen again 
<a href="Bibliography2.html#Man_in_moon">[8]</A>. Perhaps this is what 
Michael Stipe is referring to in his song <i>Belong</i>. 
A slightly different version of this poem (set in Middle Earth, rather than 
East Anglia) is found in <i>
The Adventures of Tom Bombadil </i>(also by Tolkien) <br>

"Back in '92 I used to play with a Ouija board. It produced several poems, and this was one of them. It's about a guy who falls asleep in the forest and dreams about a war between a hero and a demon hoard, with the demons intent on stealing the silver from the moon.

<br><br><h2>Led Zeppelin</h2> <br>
I couldn't leave this subject without pointing out that the man in the moon appears to have found his way 
onto the cover of Led Zeppelin's fourth album.
The cover is a painting showing an old man bent under the weight of a large bundle of 
firewood. I was told that 

Robert Plant had said that the painting was called "The Hermit", and was by a 
friend of his called Barrington Colby. I believed that there was a misunderstanding here: 
because on the reverse of the 
sleeve, there is another picture of a figure in white holding a lantern, which closely 
resembles the hermit portrayed on 
tarot cards. 
<a href="Bibliography2.html#Man_in_moon">[5]</a>. <br><br>

A few years ago my speculations on this subject were passed on to 
Barrington Colby, by "Rockhound" from Switzerland, who knows him. The figure in white on the 
inside cover is Barrington Colby's "Hermit". <br><br>
But as for the man with the bundle of sticks? well a few years later
<a href=mailto:ledzeppelin360@hotmail.com>Chad</a> 
emailed me with a quote from Jimmy Page on the subject:<br>

</i>Jimmy Page: "I used to spend a lot of time going to junk shops looking for things that 
other people might have missed. Robert was on a search with me one time, and we went to 
this place in Reading where things were just 
piled up on one another. Robert found the picture of the old man with the sticks and 
suggested that we work it into our cover somehow. So we decided to contrast the modern 
skyscraper on the back with the old man with the sticks - you see the destruction of the 
old, and the new coming 
forward. <br>

'Our hearts were as much in tune with the old ways as with what was happening, though we 
weren't always in agreement with the new. But I think the important thing was we were 
certainly keeping space...if not going beyond it. The inside cover was painted by a friend 
of mine. It's 
basically an illustration of a seeker aspiring to the light of truth.'"<br><br>

I LOVE the way that the web allows me to ask strange, questions on obscure topics and get answers from 
complete strangers! But I still don't know who painted the old man with the bundle of sticks 
(rather disrespectful of Page and Plant not to credit the artist, on the album sleeve, 
unless the painting was by that greatest artist, songwriter and poet: Anon :-). 
And does the picture represent the man in the moon? The answers may be lost in the mists of time, but I 
have a strange feeling that somebody on the web knows. So if you can shed any more light on the subject,
 please leave a message in the <a href="index.html"> guestbook </a><br><br>

<a name="*">* Bows obviously occur a lot in lunar myths, as crescent symbols. Culpepper said of willow: 
"The moon owns it". Presumably because the willow grows near water, and readily regenerates when cut down or 
pruned. The willow is also used in wickerwork and Wicca work: willow bark bound the head of the witches broom, 
and according to Julius Caesar, the druids burnt people alive at full moon, in wicker baskets. The words "witch" 
and "wicked" are related to "wicker". Willow is a source of Salicilic acid, the raw ingredient of aspirin, and was 
used in the past to cure rheumatic pain, which was supposed to be caused by witchcraft. Rejected lovers used to wear 
willow in their hats <a href="Bibliography2.html#Man_in_moon">[3]</a>.[<a href="#1">back</a>]
