<h1>The Man in the Moone</h1>
<br>
<h3>a story of space travel in the early 17th century</h3>
<p>
<p>
"The Man in the Moone" was written in 1638 by Bishop Francis Godwin of 
Hereford (1566-1633). The story was extremely popular in its day, and may have
 inspired one of the tales of <a href="tlp.html#baron">Baron Munchausen</a>. 
One of Godwin's daughters may have married into the 
family of Jonathon Swift, so Gulliver's Travels may also have been 
influenced by this story. The book has been reprinted
<a href="Bibliography2.html#godwin">[1]</a>, but is quite hard to obtain. <p>
In the book, the hero, Domingo Gonsales is marooned on an island, where he 
tames some large migratory birds known as "gansas", which are like swans, 
only having one webbed foot, and one with talons like an eagle. 
Gonsales harnesses the gansas to a contraption of his own devising, 
so that they can carry him through the air. The gansas carry him 
on their annual migration to the moon. <p>
The moon turns out to be a vast ocean with a few large islands. 
The maria are apparently dry land. He also notes the
 low gravity and the lack of wind.<p>
The moon is inhabited by a race unlike any he has ever encountered. 
Their skin is a very strange colour as Gonsales explains:<p>
<i>"For as it were a hard matter to describe unto a man born blind the 
difference betweene blew and greene, so can I not bethinke my selfe any 
meane how to decipher unto you this lunar colour, having no affinitie with 
any other that ever I beheld with mine eyes."</I><p>
The "Lunars", as he calls them, sleep whenever the sun is shining on them. 
Prefering to go about their lives in the <a href="oldnew.html">earthshine</a>. 
Presumably, the Lunars do not live on the dark side of the moon. 
The Lunar society is very civilised:<p><i>
"And because it is an inviolable decree amongst them, never to put any one 
to death, perceiving by the statute and some other notes they have, 
who are likely to bee of a wicked or imperfect disposition, they send 
them away (I know not by what meanes) into the earth, and change them 
for other children, before they shall have either abilitie or 
opportunitie to doe amisse among them: But first (they say) they are faine 
to keepe them there for a certaine space, till that the ayre of the earth 
may alter their colour to be like unto ours."</i><p>
<a name="1">
He suggests that generally they are sent to a certain hill in North America, 
and that the whole native American race he can <i>"easily beleeve to 
be wholly descended of them"</i>, because of the fondness of the Lunars for 
tobacco. However, <i>"Sometimes they mistake their aime, and fall upon 
Christendome, Asia or Affricke, marry that is but seldome: I remember
 some years since, that I read certaine stories tending to 
the confirmation of these things<a href="#*">*</a>"</I>
<p>Eventually, he harnesses up the gansas and heads for earth. He crash 
lands in China, where he narrowly escapes being executed as a sorcerer.<br><br>

* I think he may be refering to the legend of the green 
children of Woolpit, (another tall story from
