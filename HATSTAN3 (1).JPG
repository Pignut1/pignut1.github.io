Thanks for your reply and for incorporating my comments into the site. =
If
it's of any interest to you I've eventually managed to borrow a digital
camera and I've attached a couple of photos of my local hatstand for =
your
reference.
A friend I spoke to recently who's a bit of an expert on antiques thinks =
it
might be Anglo-Indian - from the days of the Empire. Hmmm......

This has nothing to do with the moon, but while we're on the subject of =
Usra
Major, it seems that the native American Algonquian tribes also likened
that constellation to a bear. There's a legend about the 'Celestial =
Bear'
whose skeleton- to cut a long story short- lays on her back in the sky
during winter then gives her life-spirit to another mythical =
(hibernating)
bear who  emerges from her den in spring to be hunted & killed all over
again. Apparently, these tribes also had some very biblical-sounding =
legends
about an ancient flood, a passage through divided water and so on, and =
used
the cross as a sacred symbol. The missionaries in those parts were =
convinced
that an apostle  had visited North America long ago and spread these =
stories,
which would presumably  explain how they arrived at the same name for =
the
constellation.  As I'm sure you know there are plenty of theories about
Celtic, Scandinavian and other peoples visiting America in the distant =
past.
Maybe we've been living in a global village for a lot longer than
conventional history records.

By the way, as you're interested in lunar literature, you might like to
check out a 'A Fire on the Moon' by Norman Mailer. If you haven't read =
it,
it's a very interesting take on the Apollo 11 mission concentrating on =
the
strange superstitious hold that the moon seemed to exert on the minds of
supposedly level-headed astronauts and NASA technicians.
It's hard going in places, but there are some very striking passages
and of course it's a great true-life adventure story.

Cheers,

Andy
