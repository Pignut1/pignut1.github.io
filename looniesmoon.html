<H1>Judge Dredd: Loonies Moon</H1><BR><BR><A name=top> 
The story so far: Following nuclear war in the 22nd century, the survivors live in vast megacities surrounded by radioactive wasteland. Megacity One is a sprawling, crime ridden termite mound of of mile high tower blocks named after twentieth century B list celebrities. In an attempt to maintain order, the police and entire legal system have been replaced by "Judges", fascistic riot cops, authorised to perform on-the-spot executions. The most notorious Judge of all is Judge Joe Dredd: A grim, faceless authority figure, a mind without love or compassion only traffic byelaws and legal jargon.....so it's nice when a little humour creeps into the grim dystopianism. <br>

This comic book story is from a 1980 issue of the British comic 2000AD, at a time when the Reverend Sun Myun Moon's Unification Church (a.k.a. The Moonies) was on the rise. <br><br>
