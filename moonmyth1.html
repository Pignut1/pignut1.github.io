<h2>Hera - Pre-Hellentic Myth<BR></h2>
<BR>
On the morning of the new moon, the women of Argos left their homes and 
walked together to the Stream of the Freeing Water. They bathed and then 
gathered branches from the nearby lygos bushes, which they laid in a 
large circular bower. On this ring they sate throughout the day, each 
seated with the women of her mother's clan. With the blessing of the 
Goddess, the lygos encouraged the flow of their sacred blood that would 
complete the cleansing they had begun in the esteem. Although the women 
fasted, their mood was not somber. They talked of their crops, their 
herds, their children and listened to stories told by the elders. As 
twilight approached, they began chants and songs that summoned Hera in 
Her manifestation of the new moon. When Hera appeared as a pale sliver 
climbing a out the horizon, the women responded by lighting  a fire in 
the center of their circle and continued the songs. Gradually Hera drew 
forth the blood of purification and renewed fertility. Gradually the 
chanting increased in tempo. Those who had received Hera's gift shared 
it with the young, the pregnant, and the old women by painting a reed 
crescent moon on their foreheads. All rose, giving praise to the 
Goddess, and returned to a torchlit procession to their homes. <BR>
<BR>
Hidden in the foothills nearby, the spring called Kanathos flowed 
secretly, silently from the Earth's womb. Each year Hera appeared to the 
Argive women at the spring. She bathed in the cool water and emerged 
with Her virginity renewed once again - One-In-Herself, the Celestial 
Virgin. The women received the blessing of Hera's grace and crowned one 
another with wreaths of aster, blossoming with the Goddess' starflowers. 
They fooled Hera to a broad terrace on the side of Mount Euboia, Her 
sacred ground.<BR>
<BR>
The Goddess looked down onto the plain stretching out before Her. All 
the people of Argos, all the animals, all the colors of spring had come
together for the Sacred Marriage. Hera presided over the joining of the
lunar cow and the solar bull. Then She looked out over the assembly and
blessed the Argives with unfailing fecundity of field and womb. They 
celebrated the promise of their survival with dances and feasting. On
that day began again the homage to Hera which continued throughout the 
year.<BR>
<BR>
Every four years the benevolence of the Goddess was celebrated at the 
feast of the Heraia. At Olympia Hera watched the footraces run in Her 
name. The races were run by girls divided into three age groups to 
represent the three phases of the moon and the corresponding three 
stages of woman's life. The winners were awarded an olive wreath and the 
horo of resembling the Goddess most closely. As Hera crowned the 
youngest winner, the girl addressed the crowd: <i>I am the new moon, 
swelling with magic, pure in my maidenhood, ever growing stronger.</I> 
The second winner spoke:<i> I am the full moon, complete in my powers, 
making people with my rhythms, bathing them in light.</I> The third 
said:<i> I am the waning moon, shrinking into peace, knowing all that 
went before, I am the old one.</I><BR>

<h2>A Norse Myth</h2><BR>
<BR>
There was a giant living in Giantland called Narfi. He had a daughter 
named Night. She was dark and swarthy, like the family to which she 
belonged. Her first marriage was with a man called Naglfari, their son 
was called Auo. Next she was married to Annar, their daughter was called 
Earth. Last, Delling married her, and he was of the family of the gods. 
Their son was Day, he was bright and beautiful like his father's side. 
Then All-father took Night and her son, Day, and gave them two horses 
and two chariots and put them up in the sky, so that they should ride 
round the world every 24 hours.  Night rides first on a horse called 
Hrimfaxi, and every morning he bedews the earth with the foam from his 
bit. Day's horse is called Skinfaxi, and the whole earth and sky are 
illumined by his mane.<BR>
<BR>
It came to pass that a man named Mundilfari had two children, a boy 
named Moon and a girl named Sun. He was an arrogant man and the gods 
took his children from him and placed them in the sky.
The gods made Sun drive the horses which drew the chariot of the sun 
that the gods had made to light the worlds from a spark.  Moon governs 
the journeying of the moon and decides the time of its waxing and 
waning.  <BR>
<BR>
There are also two wolves, which force the Sun and the Moon to move 
through the heavens. One is pursuing the Sun, who is called Skoll; she 
fears him and he will ultimately catch her.  The other that runs in 
front of the Sun, is called Hati Hroovitnisson, and he wants to catch 
the Moon and will in the end.<BR>

<h2>The Book of Revelation; Chapter 12, Verses 1-6</h2><BR>
<BR>
And a great portent appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, 
with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars; 
she was with child and she cried out in her pangs of birth, in anguish 
for delivery. And another portent appeared in heaven; behold, a great 
red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems upon his
heads. His tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven, and cast them 
to earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a 
child, that he might devour her child when she brought it forth; she 
brought forth a male child, one who is to rule all the nations which a 
rod of iron, but her child was caught up to God and to his throne, and 
the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by 
God, in which to be nourished to 1260 days.<BR>

<h2>Hina-i-ka-malama - Hawaiian Moon Goddess</h2><BR>
<BR>
Hinaikamalama (Hina in the moon), worked day after day at beating and 
creating tapa (cloth made from bark). Finally, tiring of this ceaseless 
labor, she packed her ipu (gourd) and travelled by the "rainbow path" up 
to the sun. This proved far too hot to be her new home, so she climbed 
to the moon, although her husband tried to force her to stay on Earth. 
Today, when the full moon shines, Hina can still be seen on the 
moon.<BR>

<h2>The Monkeys and the Moon - Tibetan Tale</h2>
<BR><BR>
In long-past times there lived a band of monkeys in a forest. As they 
rambled about they saw the reflection of the moon in a well, and the 
leader of the band said: "O friends, the moon has fallen into the well. 
The world is now without a moon. Ought not we to draw it out?"<BR>
<BR>
The monkeys said, "Good; we will draw it out."<BR>
<BR>
So they began to hold counsel as to how they were to draw it out.  Some 
of them said, "Do not you kow? The monkeys must form a chain, and so 
draw the moon out."<BR>
<BR>
So they formed a chain, the first monkey hanging on to the branch of a 
tree, and the second to the first monkey's tail, and a third one in its 
turn to the tail of the second one.  When in this way they were all 
hanging on to one another, the branch began to bend a good deal.  The 
water became troubled, the reaction of the moon disappeared, the branch 
broke, and all the monkeys fell into the well and were disagreeably 
damaged.<BR>
<BR>
A deity uttered this verse: "When the foolish have a foolish leader they
all go to ruin like the monkeys which wanted to draw the moon up from 
the well."<BR><BR><BR>
